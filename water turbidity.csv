In this area, iron-rich Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and baleen whale species, which are among their main predators, play a large role in the recycling of iron. However, penguins have received limited attention despite their representing the largest seabird biomass in the southern polar region. Here, we use breeding site guano volumes estimated from drone images, deep learning-powered penguin census, and guano chemical composition to assess the iron export to the Antarctic waters from one of the most abundant penguin species, the Chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarcticus). Our results show that these seabirds are a relevant contributor to the iron remobilization pool in the Southern Ocean. With an average guano concentration of 3 mg iron g−1, we estimate that the Chinstrap penguin population is recycling 521 tonnes iron yr−1, representing the current iron contribution half of the amount these penguins were able to recycle four decades ago, as they have declined by more than 50% since then. © 2023, The Author(s).",,"iron; sea water; water; biochemical composition; breeding site; guano; iron; machine learning; recycling; remobilization; seabird; antarctic circumpolar current; Article; baleen whale; biomass; breeding; carbon fixation; chemical composition; coastal waters; concentration (parameter); continental shelf; deep learning; Euphausia superba; geomorphology; ice sheet; marine environment; nonhuman; penguin; penguin guano; phytoplankton; plume; population dynamics; Pygoscelis antarcticus; sea ice; seabird; seashore; Southern Ocean; turbidity; vapor; animal; Antarctica; krill; sea; Southern Ocean; Animals; Antarctic Regions; Biomass; Euphausiacea; Oceans and Seas; Spheniscidae",,"iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6; water, 7732-18-5",,,"EQC2018-004275-P, EQC2019-005721-P, MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033, PID2021-125783OB-I00; IJC2018-037545-I; PRE2019-089679; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","This research has been funded by the Spanish Government projects PIMETAN (ref.

In this study, a deep learning-based method integrating graph convolution network (GCN), gravity model variant, and dual feedback machine involving parametric probability analysis and spatial distribution pattern analysis, named Graph Convolution Network with Superposition of Multi-point Effect (SMPE-GCN) has been developed to calculate concentrations of WQPs through UAV hyperspectral reflectance data on large scale efficiently. With an end-to-end structure, our proposed method has been applied to assisting environmental protection department to trace potential pollution sources in real time. The proposed method is trained on a real-world dataset and its effectiveness is validated on an equal amount of testing dataset with respect to three evaluation metrics including root of mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute percent error (MAPE), and coefficient of determination (R2). The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves better performance in comparison with state-of-the-art baseline models in terms of RMSE, MAPE, and R2. The proposed method is applicable for quantifying seven various WQPs and has achieved good performance for each WQP. The resulting MAPE ranges from 7.16% to 10.96% and R2 ranges from 0.80 to 0.94 for all WQPs. This approach brings a novel and systematic insight into real-time quantitative water quality monitoring of urban rivers, and provides a unified framework for in-situ data acquisition, feature engineering, data conversion, and data modeling for further research.

The higher concentration of suspended material is a major barrier in assessing bathymetry accurately with remote sensing data. The influence of various optically active substances (OAS) needs to be quantified to develop a more robust SDB algorithm. The goal of the study is to improve the accuracy of SDB by understanding the spatial distribution of Chlorophyll (Chl), Total Suspended Material (TSM), and Turbidity in coastal water. A preliminary investigation using the numerical analysis between Landsat-7 & 8 spectral bands, OAS parameters, and bathymetry is presented in this paper. SDB has been derived using three machine learning algorithms; Linear, Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) Regression. The resulting SDB residuals have been analyzed in relation to Chlorophyll, Turbidity, and TSM in coastal seawater. The study found that most of the erroneous SDB residuals and extreme values were distributed in high or medium concentrated OAS regions. The result of the study may further enhance SDB estimation accuracy by considering the influence of the above three OAS in coastal waters. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Hydrography; INCOIS-SATCORE; Machine learning; Satellite-Derived Bathymetry",,,,,,"Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services, INCOIS","Authors would like to thank the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information System (INCOIS) project SATellite Coastal and Oceanographic Research (SATCORE) for providing data.",,,,,,,,,,"Ashphaq, M., Bathymetry estimation in turbid water using SENTINEL-2 image (2017) Indian Cartogr., 38, pp. 1-7; Ashphaq, M., Srivastava, P.K., Mitra, D., Review of near-shore satellite derived bathymetry: Classification and account of five decades of coastal bathymetry research (2021) Journal of Ocean Engineering and Science, 6 (4), pp. 340-359; Ashphaq, M., Srivastava, P.K., Mitra, D., Analysis of univariate linear, robust-linear, and non-linear machine learning algorithms for satellite-derived bathymetry in complex coastal terrain (2022) Reg.

While machine learning models have a great ability to handle nonlinear relationships in the process, changes in raw water quality and process operations can make predictions difficult. This study investigated the use of machine learning models, including traditional and deep learning approaches, for predicting both coagulant dosage and settled water turbidity in the water treatment process using six years of operating data. The study found that deep learning models, which process temporal sequential data, significantly improved prediction accuracies in response to changing dynamics of water treatment processes. The results emphasize the importance of collecting large datasets for modeling water treatment processes to capture rapid changes in raw water quality, thereby increasing prediction accuracies. The modeling results provide suggestions for model selection, data collection, and monitoring implementation in water treatment plants, which can enhance the accuracy of predictions and ensure high-quality treated water. © 2023","Artificial neural network; Big data; Deep learning; Graph attention network; Machine learning; Water treatment processes",,,,,,"2019002710006; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF: 2022R1A2C1009242","This study was performed with the support of the Ministry of Environment Republic of Korea ( 2019002710006 ) and the National Research Foundation of Korea ( 2022R1A2C1009242 ).

Moreover, monitoring stations are often remote and technical issues resulting in data gaps are common. Machine learning algorithms can be applied to fill these gaps, and to a certain extent, for predictions and interpretation. The objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate six different machine learning models for gap-filling in a high-frequency nitrate and total phosphorus concentration time series, (2) to showcase the potential added value (and limitations) of machine learning to interpret underlying processes, and (3) to study the limits of machine learning algorithms for predictions outside the training period. We used a 4-year high-frequency dataset from a ditch draining one intensive dairy farm in the east of The Netherlands. Continuous time series of precipitation, evapotranspiration, groundwater levels, discharge, turbidity, and nitrate or total phosphorus were used as predictors for total phosphorus and nitrate concentrations respectively. Our results showed that the random forest algorithm had the best performance to fill in data-gaps, with R 2 higher than 0.92 and short computation times. The feature importance helped understanding the changes in transport processes linked to water conservation measures and rain variability. Applying the machine learning model outside the training period resulted in a low performance, largely due to system changes (manure surplus and water conservation) which were not included as predictors. This study offers a valuable and novel example of how to use and interpret machine learning models for post-processing high-frequency water quality data. © 2023, The Author(s).","Data-based models; Groundwater surface water interactions; Missing data; Random forest; Water management","Catchments; Continuous time systems; Farms; Fertilizers; Forestry; Groundwater; Learning systems; Machine learning; Nitrates; Surface waters; Time series; Water conservation; Water management; Water quality; Data based model; Ground water/surface water interactions; High frequency HF; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Missing data; Random forests; Total phosphorus; Transport process; Waters managements; Forecasting",,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 813438","We would like to acknowledge the Farmer, Water Board Rhine and IJssel, Thilo Behrends and the P-TRAP group for the discussions.

This study sought to identify a successful predictive machine learning model with minimal parameters from easy-to-deploy, low-cost sensors to create a monitoring system for the urban stream network, Hunnicutt Creek, in Clemson, SC, USA. A multiple linear regression model was compared to machine learning algorithms k-nearest neighbor, decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosting. These algorithms were evaluated to understand which best predicted dissolved oxygen (DO) from water temperature, conductivity, turbidity, and water level change at four locations along the urban stream. The random forest algorithm had the highest performance in predicting DO for all four sites, with Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE) scores > 0.9 at three sites and > 0.598 at the fourth site. The random forest model was further examined using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and found that temperature influenced the DO predictions for three of the four sites, but there were different water quality interactions depending on site location. Calculating the land cover type in each site’s sub-watershed revealed that different amounts of impervious surface and vegetation influenced water quality and the resulting DO predictions. Overall, machine learning combined with land cover data helps decision-makers better understand the nuances of urban watersheds and the relationships between urban land cover and water quality. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Artificial intelligence; Machine learning; Regression; Water quality; Water resources; Watershed","algorithm; artificial intelligence; comparative study; dissolved oxygen; stream; urbanization; water level; water quality; water resource; water stress; watershed; Clemson; South Carolina; United States",,,,,"2020–70003-32310; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, NIFA","This work was supported by the Clemson University Hunnicutt Creek Project and the Higher Education Challenge (HEC) grants program [grant no. 2020–70003-32310] from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

The Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) installed in the Sentinel-3 satellite could help to monitor turbidity variations due to its narrow spectral bandwidth and high revisit time. This makes us develop suitable turbidity algorithms for mapping the dynamics of lake turbidity using OLCI imagery. In this study, a total of 1081 samples were collected from 73 typical lakes across China during 2017–2022. Here, we developed and proposed applicable turbidity algorithms i.e., SR (simple regression), PLSR (partial least squares regression), SVR (support vector regression), BP (backpropagation neural network), KNN (K-nearest neighbor), RF (random forest), and XGBoost (extreme gradient boosting), which integrate a broad scale dataset of turbidity ranging from 0.15 NTU to 262.57 NTU using OLCI imagery. The performance results of developed turbidity algorithms demonstrated that RF obtained performed best with good agreements of measured- and derived- fitting (validation dataset: R2 = 0.92, MAPE = 54.32%, RMSE = 12.65 NTU). This allowed us to estimate turbidity concentration in Chinese lakes with a surface area&gt;20 km2. The averaged turbidity level of lake groups in five lake regions was investigated with a decreased tendency as Northeast Plain Lake Region (NPL, 63.31 NTU) &gt; Eastern Plain Lake Region (EPL, 58.30 NTU) &gt; Inner Mongolia–Xinjiang Lake Region (IMXL, 16.64 NTU) &gt; Yunnan–Guizhou Plateau Lake Region (YGPL, 11.63 NTU) &gt; Tibetan Plateau Lake Region (TPL, 7.05 NTU). Further, we analyze the distributions of lake turbidity considering different land use types, and the results showed a decreasing tendency as cropland (56.97 NTU) &gt; barren land (11.22 NTU) &gt; grassland (8.06 NTU) &gt; forest (4.71 NTU). Our results demonstrated and highlighted the quantification of lake turbidity concentrations using OLCI imagery and the stability of the RF algorithm, which can generate turbidity data for large-scale monitoring and decision-making related to environmental protection. © 2023","Machine learning; Random forest; Sentinel-3 OLCI; Turbidity","Backpropagation; Decision making; Forecasting; Forestry; Land use; Landforms; Least squares approximations; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Random forests; Regression analysis; Support vector machines; Turbidity; Water quality; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Monitoring water quality; Optical-; Partial least square regression; Random forests; Sentinel-3 ocean and land color instrument; Simple++; Spectral bandwidth; Support vector regressions; Lakes; algorithm; grassland; lake water; machine learning; Sentinel; turbidity; China",,,,,"Jilin Province Development and Reform Commission: 2021C044-2; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 42001311, 42071336, 42101366, 42171374, 42171385, 42201414, 42201433, U2243230; Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS: 2021SYHZ0002","This research was jointly supported in part by the Natural Science Foundation of China (U2243230, 42201414, 42171374, 42071336, 42171385, 42101366, 42201433 and 42001311), Cooperation program of Jilin province and CAS (2021SYHZ0002), Jilin Provincial Development and Reform Commission program (2021C044-2) and Land Observation Satellite Supporting Platform of National Civil Space Infrastructure Project (CASPLOS-CCSI).

However, advanced oxidation methods are costly, and data-driven modeling methods based on traditional machine learning algorithms for detecting time-delayed WQIs have limited detection accuracy. This work develops deep learning models based on long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to detect time-delayed WQIs in WWTPs intake accurately. The lack of interpretability of the deep learning models hampers the optimization of the developed LSTM models in applications. Therefore, a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) based on Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) is performed to quantify the contribution of the input indicators to detection results of the developed LSTM models. The direct contributions provide the basis for optimizing the input indicators to achieve more cost-effective modeling detection. In the case study, the developed LSTM models achieved good accuracy (R2 of 0.9141, 0.9239, and 0.9040, respectively) in detecting chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus in the influent of a WWTP, outperforming the four types of baseline models. According to the SHAP values, the contributions of dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and ammonia nitrogen to the above detection targets are always in the top third of all input indicators, which are more outstanding than meteorological indicators. Removing the indicator with the smallest SHAP value reduces the build and run costs of the models with minimal loss of detection accuracy. Combining deep learning and GSA to detect WWTPs influent is a novel and effective attempt. This attempt provides a more sustainable solution for rapid and accurate detection of time-delayed WQIs, which drives WWTPs' operation in an intelligent, clean, and safe direction. © 2023","Deep learning; Energy saving; Global sensitivity analysis; Multiple variables driven; Time delay; Wastewater treatment plant influent","Ammonia; Digital storage; Dissolved oxygen; Energy efficiency; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Mean square error; Nitrogen; Nitrogen removal; Quality control; Reclamation; Sewage pumping plants; Timing circuits; Wastewater treatment; Water quality; Water treatment plants; Deep learning; Energy savings; Energy-savings; Global sensitivity analysis; Multiple variable driven; Plant influents; Time-delays; Waste water treatment plants; Wastewater treatment plant influent; Water quality indicators; Time delay",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Gu, Y., Li, Y., Li, X., Luo, P., Wang, H., Robinson, Z.P., Wang, X., Li, F., The feasibility and challenges of energy self-sufficient wastewater treatment plants (2017) Appl.

Manually collecting samples and sending them to a research center for discovery and analysis is the typical approach for gathering information on water qualities. However, this approach is illogical in the long run because it requires a lot of time and labor. This paper aimed to construct, test, and evaluate the usefulness of machine learning and the Internet of Things (IoT) at water storage stations. First, we developed a system prototype and assessed its performance using classifier and reliability matrices. This study considers water's physical and chemical parameters to evaluate the level of water pollutants present in drinking water. The parameters measured include temperature, pH, turbidity, Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Oxidation Reduction Potential (ORP), and electrical conductivity. After analyzing the sensor data, we used Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) machine learning algorithms to forecast the impurity level of the water measured. The performance showed that the ANN models used have the highest accuracy and are the most suitable to predict water source and status. We also introduced a water treatment method to provide an automated corrective measure based on a specific amount of water contamination. Based on the system's results, we concluded that AI and IoT are more efficient in remotely monitoring safe and harmful water conditions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Internet of Things (IoT); Machine learning; Water quality monitoring; Water treatment",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Chowdury, M.S.U., IoT based real-time river water quality monitoring system (2019) Procedia Comput.

A commonly used method for assessing water quality is the Water Quality Index (WQI). Artificial intelligence (AI) can predict the WQI rapidly and more accurately than conventional methods. In this study, a stacking ensemble model based on Deep Learning (DL) was proposed to predict the WQI by integrating three models: Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Generalized Linear Model (GLM) and Neural Network (NN). The performance of this model was compared with that of Deep Dense Neural Network (DNN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The inclusion of a DNN model, which was used for the first time in water pollution research to perform sensitivity and uncertainty analysis in predicting WQI, added a new dimension to the workflow. The mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient (R2) were used to evaluate the performance of the WQI prediction models. The results showed that the WQI of the water samples ranged from 90.75 to 145.29, indicating poor to very poor water quality. The validation results showed that the stack model was superior to all other models in terms of prediction accuracy, with MSE of 25.77, RMSE of 5.07, MAE of 3.5 and R2 of 0.98. The DNN-based sensitivity analysis showed that pH and turbidity significantly affect the WQI and should be monitored to minimise water pollution. The uncertainty analysis indicated that electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids have the highest uncertainty in predicting WQI. This study provides researchers, decision makers and water scientists with accurate information on water quality and enables the implementation of clean production processes to reduce pollution and improve water quality. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Convolutional neural network; Deep learning algorithm; Lake water quality; Loktak lake; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Decision making; Deep learning; Errors; Forecasting; Lakes; Learning algorithms; Mean square error; Quality control; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Water pollution; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning algorithm; Lake water quality; Loktak lake; Mean absolute error; Means square errors; Neural-networks; Performance; Root mean square errors; Water quality indexes; Water quality",,,,,"2022; University Grants Commission, UGC: 202122-ES/19-20/0030","Recent studies have applied various machine learning algorithms to predict water quality in lakes, groundwater, and rivers (Zhu et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2021; Nayan et al., 2020; Chou et al., 2018; Kouadri et al., 2021; Nasir et al., 2022; Afzaal et al., 2019). The most widely used ML algorithms include artificial neural networks (ANN) (Gupta et al., 2019; Vijay and Kamaraj, 2021; Trach et al., 2022; Ubah et al., 2021), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (Tiwari et al., 2018; Sahoo et al., 2021), random forest (Tung and Yaseen, 2021; Bui et al., 2020; Sakaa et al., 2022), support vector machine (Leong et al., 2021; Chia et al., 2022; Singh et al., 2011), Radial Basis Function (Abba et al., 2020; Leong et al., 2021), Gradient Boosting Machine (Nayan et al., 2020; Khoi et al., 2022), Generalized Linear Model (Dimple et al., 2022; Pujar et al., 2020), among others. For example, Nayan et al. (2020) used the GBM model to predict the WQI of multiple rivers in Bangladesh with high accuracy. Chou et al. (2018) evaluated four AI models, ANN, SVM, CART, and linear regression, to predict the WQI of 20 reservoirs in Taiwan and found that the ANN model was the most effective. Kouadri et al. (2021) applied eight ML algorithms to predict WQI for the Illizi region in southeastern Algeria and found that multi-linear regression outperformed the other models. Yaseen et al. (2018) used several ML models to predict the WQI and found that ML algorithms can solve non-linear problems with high accuracy. However, the performance of these models depends on the input factors, algorithm selection, and output variables, so researchers must evaluate different models under different conditions for various problems.The authors would like to express their sincere gratitude to the Department of Geography at Jamia Millia Islamia for providing the necessary research facilities for this study.

To tackle this problem, in this paper, a novel online detection method is proposed, which can effectively avoid the physical and chemical interferences caused by suspended particles. First, UV–vis spectroscopy is innovatively utilized in the oxidative digestion process to continuously monitor the substance transformation during the reaction. Then, based on dictionary learning and LASSO regression, a novel machine learning method, bidirectional dictionary LASSO regression (BD-LASSO), is developed. BD-LASSO can bidirectionally implement the dictionary learning from both spectrum and feature aspects, ensuring the information extraction at the feature level and therefore improving the detection accuracy and speed. Based on the experimental results, our method can more effectively eliminate the interference brought by turbidity with a much higher detection accuracy (relative error <10%) and a far shorter detection time (within 5 min). © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Chemical oxygen demand; Dictionary learning; LASSO regression; UV–vis spectroscopy; Water quality monitoring","article; chemical oxygen demand; extraction; learning; least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; machine learning; turbidity; ultraviolet visible spectroscopy; velocity; waste water treatment plant; water monitoring; water quality",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Chow, C.W.K., Liu, J.X., Li, J.Y., Swain, N., Reid, K., Saint, C.P., Development of smart data analytics tools to support wastewater treatment plant operation (2018) Chemometr.

Box 12, Annaba, 23000, Algeria","Despite the high importance of coagulation process in drinking water treatment plant (DWTP), challenge remains in effectively linking raw water quality measured at the inlet of the DWTP with coagulant dosage rate. This study proposes an integral modelling framework using hybrid extreme learning machine and Bat metaheuristic algorithm (ELM-Bat) for modelling coagulant dosage rate using water temperature, pH, specific conductance, dissolved oxygen, and water turbidity. The aluminum sulphate (Al2 (SO4)3.18H2O) coagulant is determined using conventional Jar-Test procedure. Results obtained using the hybrid ELM-Bat were compared to those obtained using standalone ELM, outlier robust extreme learning machine (ORELM), online sequential extreme learning machine (OSELM), optimally pruned extreme learning machine (OPELM), and kernel extreme learning machine (KELM). First, the models have been calibrated during the training stage and in a second stage; they are validated using various statistical metrics, i.e., RMSE, MAE, the correlation coefficient (R), and the Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE). We found that the hybrid ELM-Bat was significantly more accurate and it has yielded accuracy higher than all other models. During the validation stage, the R and NSE values calculated using the ELM-Bat were ≈0.959 and ≈0.918 exhibiting an improvement rates of approximately (≈15.26% and ≈33.82%), (≈10.35% and ≈21.92%), (≈14.98% and ≈31.89%), (≈7.63% and ≈16.35%), (≈10.99% and ≈23.05%), compared to the values obtained using the ELM, OPELM, OSELM, KELM and ORELM, respectively. Besides, the new ELM-Bat model has shown to have high predictive capabilities, which can be used optimally for calculating the optimal coagulant dosage with high accuracy.

The supervised learning model has been addressed starting from the knowledge of data color, turbidity and pH at the water inlet to the aqueduct and the dosing results of type A aluminum sulfate and calcium oxide (lime) obtained through jar tests. The construction of the automatic learning model had a comprehensive implementation and improvement field through continuous system training, which allowed an optimal dosage of Aluminum Sulfate and Lime to generate an outlet pH less than 7.5 and outlet turbidity less than 8 nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU). Those outlet water parameters meet the ministry of social protection criteria in Colombia. Also, a virtual jar test was created to reduce the time required to obtain chemical dosing values to less than a minute.

The models were trained using data collected over a seven year period covering water quality and operating variables, including true colour, turbidity, plant flow, and chemical dose for chlorine, KMnO4, FeCl3, and Cationic Polymer (PolyDADMAC). The machine learning algorithms have shown that the best prediction is at a 1-day time lag between input variables and unit filter run volume (UFRV). Furthermore, the RF algorithm with grid search using the input metrics mentioned above with a 1-day time lag has provided the highest reliability in predicting UFRV with a RMSE and R2 of 31.58 and 0.98, respectively. Similarly, RF with grid search has shown the shortest training time, prediction accuracy, and forecasting events using a ROC-AUC curve analysis (AUC over 0.8) in extreme wet weather events. Therefore, Random Forest with grid search and a 1-day time lag is an effective and robust machine learning algorithm that can predict the filter performance to aid water treatment operators in their decision makings by providing real-time warning of the potential turbidity breakthrough from the filters. © 2023 The Author(s)","Filtration performance; Hyper-parameter optimisation; Machine learning approach; Unit filter run volume","Decision trees; Iron compounds; Learning systems; Machine learning; Multiple linear regression; Potash; Turbidity; Water quality; Water treatment; Filter performance; Filtration performance; Grid search; Hyper-parameter optimizations; Machine learning algorithms; Machine learning approaches; Medium filter; Random forests; Time lag; Unit filter run volume; Forecasting; chlorine; drinking water; ferric chloride; filtration; machine learning; optimization; performance assessment; turbidity; water quality; water treatment; Article; decision tree; forecasting; gaussian process regression; human; machine learning; multivariable linear regression; random forest; support vector machine; task performance; turbidity; unit filter run volume; volume; water filtration; water quality; water supply; water treatment; weather; algorithm; reproducibility; statistical model; Algorithms; Forecasting; Linear Models; Machine Learning; Reproducibility of Results",,"chlorine, 13981-72-1, 7782-50-5; ferric chloride, 7705-08-0",,,"Water Research Australia; Australian Research Council, ARC: LP160100620","This research was supported via the Australian Research Council's Linkage Projects funding scheme (project number LP160100620) which included support from Sydney Water and WaterNSW.

This study explored the use of remote sensing imagery and machine learning (ML) algorithms as an alternative to standard field measuring for monitoring water quality in large and remote areas constrained by logistics and finance. Six machine learning (ML) algorithms integrated with Landsat 8 imagery were evaluated for their accuracy in predicting three optically active water quality indicators observed monthly in the period from August 2016 to April 2022: turbidity (TUR), total dissolved solids (TDS) and Chlorophyll a (Chl-a). The six ML algorithms studied were the artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine regression (SVM), random forest regression (RF), XGBoost regression (XGB), AdaBoost regression (AB), and gradient boosting regression (GB) algorithms. XGB performed best at predicting Chl-a, with an R2 of 0.78, Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.78, mean absolute relative error (MARE) of 0.082 and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 9.79 µg/L. RF performed best at predicting TDS (with an R2 of 0.79, NSE of 0.80, MARE of 0.082, and RMSE of 12.30 mg/L) and TUR (with an R2 of 0.80, NSE of 0.81, and MARE of 0.072 and RMSE of 7.82 NTU). The main challenges were data size, sampling frequency, and sampling resolution. To overcome the data limitation, we used a K-fold cross validation technique that could obtain the most out of the limited data to build a robust model. Furthermore, we also employed stratified sampling techniques to improve the ML modeling for turbidity. Thus, this study shows the possibility of monitoring water quality in large freshwater bodies with limited observed data using remote sensing integrated with ML algorithms, potentially enhancing decision making. © 2023 by the authors.","Lake Tana; Landsat; machine learning; water quality",,,,,,"AID-OAA-A-13-0055, AID-OAA-L-14-00006; United States Agency for International Development, USAID; Styrelsen för Internationellt Utvecklingssamarbete, Sida; International Development Research Centre, IDRC","This research was made possible through initial support provided by the U.S. Agency for International Development under the Feed the Future Evaluation of the Relationship between Sustainably Intensified Production Systems and Farm Family Nutrition (SIPS-IN) project (AID-OAA-L-14-00006) with additional support from the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Small Scale Irrigation (contract no.

In calculating a Water Quality Index (WQI), traditional methods require the evaluation of many water quality parameters, making them costly and time-consuming. In recent years, machine learning (ML) algorithms have emerged as an effective tool to solve many environmental problems, including water quality management. In this study, we investigate the performance of the ML-based method in calculating the WQI. We apply several feature selection techniques to select the key parameters fed the ML models. Experiments are carried out to evaluate the WQI based on a dataset collected from 2007 to 2020 of An Kim Hai system, one of the most important irrigation systems in the north of Vietnam. The obtained results show that the application of selection methods allows reducing significantly the number of water quality parameters fed the ML models without losing their accuracy. In particular, by using the embedded method, we find out four important parameters, including Coliform, DO, Turbidity, and TSS, that have the greatest impact on water quality. Based on these parameters, the Random Forest model provides the best accuracy in predicting the WQI values from the An Kim Hai system with a Similarity of 0.94. The combination of feature selection and ML methods is then considered an effective alternative for calculating the WQI, leading to a desirable performance and a reduction of input parameters. This makes water quality monitoring less costly, substantial effort, and time. © 2023","Embedded method; Feature selection; Machine learning; Random Forest; Water quality index","experimental study; index method; irrigation system; machine learning; performance assessment; prediction; water quality; Viet Nam",,,,,,"This research was funded by Thuyloi University Foundation for Science and Technology .",,,,,,,,,,"Ahmed, A.N., Othman, F.B., Afan, H.A., Ibrahim, R.K., Fai, C.M., Hossain, M.S., Ehteram, M., Elshafie, A., Machine learning methods for better water quality prediction (2019) J.

However, seasonal fluctuations of water quality in influent remain a significant challenge for rural decentralized water supply, which was a potential threat to water safety. The frequent operation was required to ensure the effluent water quality by the experienced technicians, who were in shortage in rural areas. If the operational parameters prediction model based on water quality could be established, it might reduce the dependence on technicians. Therefore, an artificial neural network (ANN) model combined with genetic algorithm (GA) was used to establish a prediction model for unattended intelligent operation. Data on water quality and operational parameters were collected from a practical EC system in a decentralized water treatment plant. Seven water quality parameters (e.g., turbidity, temperature, pH and conductivity) were selected as input variables and the operational current was employed as the output. A non-linear relationship between water quality parameters and the operational current was verified by correlation analysis and principal component analysis (PCA). The mean squared error (MSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) were used as evaluation indexes to optimize the structure of the GA-ANN model. Influent turbidity was identified to be crucial in the GA-ANN model by model interpretation using sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis. The Garson weight of turbidity in the seven input variables achieved 45.4%. The predictive accuracy of the GA-ANN model sharply declined from 90% to 67.1% when influent turbidity data were absent. In addition, it was estimated that energy consumption savings of the GA-ANN method declined by 14.2% in comparison with the gradient control method. This study verifies the feasibility and stability of machine learning strategy for unattended operation in the rural decentralized water treatment plant. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial neural network; Decentralized water supply; Electrocoagulation; Genetic algorithm; Prediction","artificial neural network; coagulation; drinking water; effluent; genetic algorithm; machine learning; principal component analysis; turbidity; water quality; article; artificial neural network; conductance; controlled study; correlation analysis; electrocoagulation; energy consumption; feasibility study; genetic algorithm; machine learning; mean squared error; pH; prediction; principal component analysis; sensitivity analysis; turbidity; water quality; water supply; water treatment; electrocoagulation; machine learning; procedures; water management; Electrocoagulation; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Water Purification; Water Quality",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 52000174; Young Scientists Fund","The authors are grateful for the financial support from the Young Scientists Fund of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 52000174 ).",,,,,,,,,,"Aber, S., Amani-Ghadim, A.R., Mirzajani, V., Removal of Cr(VI) from polluted solutions by electrocoagulation: modeling of experimental results using artificial neural network (2009) J.

Most such urban water bodies are long and narrow, so ordinary remote-sensing data sources are not suitable for monitoring. To address this problem, we use the four water-quality metrics of total nitrogen, total phosphorus, turbidity, and algal density as detected from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote-sensing images. We apply an improved least squares model to evaluate and invert the water quality in the complex freshwater environments of Longhu Lake, which is a tributary of the Yangtze River. These environments combine the polymor-phism characteristics of urban rivers. The results show that (1) the band-ratio model is appropri-ate to estimate the water-quality parameters, and inversion by band combination is more accurate than inversion with a single band. (2) Comparison of the unary linear function, polynomial func-tion, and exponential function with the least squares model shows that the latter produces the best inversion results and the smallest error. In addition, data from different periods are summed to verify the applicability of the model. The inversion results indicate that the elements responsible for polluting city rivers must be further explored by comparing point source pollution with non-point source pollution. The results show that the UAV multispectral estimation model based on the least squares method is accurate and stable and can provide strong support for water-qual-ity monitoring in small areas. This method has important practical significance for improving intelligent and automated water-monitoring technology. © 2023 Desalination Publications.

A case study was conducted on Yuandang Lake in the Yangtze Delta region, with a surface area of 13 km2. This study proposed utilising a multispectral uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) to collect large-scale data and retrieve multiple water quality parameters using machine learning algorithms. An alternate processing method is proposed to process large and repetitive lake surface images for mapping the water quality data to the image. Machine learning regression methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Backpropagation Neural Network, and Convolutional Neural Network) were used to construct separate water quality inversion models for ten water parameters. The results showed that several water quality parameters (CODMn, temperature, pH, DO, and NC) can be retrieved with reasonable accuracy (R2 = 0.77, 0.75, 0.73, 0.67, and 0.64, respectively), although others (NH3-N, BGA, TP, Turbidity, and Chl-a) have a determination coefficient (R2) less than 0.6. This work demonstrated the tremendous potential of employing multispectral data in conjunction with machine learning algorithms to retrieve multiple water quality parameters for monitoring medium-sized bodies of water. © 2023 by the authors.","inland waters; machine learning; medium-sized lake; multiple water parameters; multispectral image; uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV); water quality",,,,,,"Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, XJTLU: RDH-101-2022-0032","This research was funded by Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University Urban and Environmental Studies University Research Center, grant number RDH-101-2022-0032.",,,,,,,,,,"(2002), China, Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People’s Republic of China, Beijing, China; Thiemann, S., Kaufmann, H., Determination of chlorophyll content and trophic state of lakes using field spectrometer and IRS-1C satellite data in the Mecklenburg Lake District, Germany (2000) Remote Sens.

To this end, we built and compared the ability of dynamic regression (auto-regressive integrated moving average [ARIMA]), long short-term memory neural nets (LSTM), and generalized additive models (GAM) to forecast stream turbidity one step ahead, using surrogate data from relatively low-cost in-situ sensors and publicly available databases. We iteratively trialled combinations of four surrogate covariates (rainfall, water level, air temperature and total global solar exposure) selecting a final model for each type that minimized the corrected Akaike information criterion. Cross-validation using a rolling time-window indicated that ARIMA, which included the rainfall and water-level covariates only, produced the most accurate predictions, followed closely by GAM, which included all four covariates. However, according to the no-free-lunch theorems in machine learning, no single model has an advantage over all other models for all instances. Therefore, we constructed a meta-model, trained on time-series features of turbidity, to take advantage of the strengths of each model over different time points and predict the best model (that with the lowest forecast error one-step prior) for each time step. The meta-model outperformed all other models, indicating that this methodology can yield high accuracy and may be a viable alternative to using measurements sourced directly from turbidity-sensors where costs prohibit their deployment and maintenance, and when predicting turbidity across the short term. Our findings also indicated that temperature and light-associated variables, for example underwater illuminance, may hold promise as cost-effective, high-frequency surrogates of turbidity, especially when combined with other covariates, like rainfall, that are typically measured at coarse levels of spatial resolution. © 2023 The Authors.

Traditional methods to retrieve optically active water quality parameters from satellite data are based on semi-empirical models relying on few bands, which often revealed to be site and season specific. The use of machine learning (ML) for remotely sensed water quality estimation has spread in recent years thanks to the advances in algorithm development and computing power. These models allow to exploit the wealth of spectral information through more flexible relationships and are less affected by atmospheric and other background factors. The present study explores the use of Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) Level-1C Top of Atmosphere spectral radiance to derive water turbidity, through application of machine learning techniques. A dataset of 222 combination of turbidity measurements, collected in the North Tyrrhenian Sea – Italy from 2015 to 2021, and values of the 13 spectral bands in the pixel corresponding to the sample location was used. Two regression techniques were tested and compared: a Stepwise Linear Regression (SLR) and a Polynomial Kernel Regression. The two models show accurate and similar performance (R2 = 0.736, RMSE = 2.03 NTU, MAE = 1.39 NTU for the SLR and R2 = 0.725, RMSE = 2.07 NTU, MAE = 1.40 NTU for the Kernel). A band importance analysis revealed the contribution of the different spectral bands and the main role of the red-edge range. The work shows that it is possible to reach a good accuracy in turbidity estimation from MSI TOA reflectance using ML models, fed by the whole spectrum of available bands, although the possible generation of errors related to atmospheric effect in turbidity estimates was not evaluated. Comparison between turbidity estimates obtained from the models with turbidity data from Copernicus CMEMS dataset named ‘Mediterranean Sea, Bio-Geo-Chemical, L3, daily observation’ produced consistent results. Finally, turbidity maps from satellite imagery were produced for the study area, showing the ability of the models to catch extreme events. © 2023","Machine learning; Satellite remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Turbidity; Water quality",,,,,,"Interreg; European Commission, EC; Istituto Nazionale per l'Assicurazione Contro Gli Infortuni sul Lavoro, INAIL: BRIC/2021/ID3","As no atmospheric parameters, coherent in space and time with the processed images, are available for the present study (Pisanti et al., 2022) and no in-situ optical data is available to support the choice of an AC algorithm, the 13 Level-1C TOA spectral bands were chosen to train the predictive models.

This study provides a deep learning approach to determine coagulant dosage and/or the settled water turbidity using long-term data between 2011 and 2021 to include the effect of various weather conditions. A graph attention multivariate time series forecasting (GAMTF) model was developed to determine coagulant dosage and was compared with conventional machine learning and deep learning models. The GAMTF model (R2 = 0.94, RMSE = 3.55) outperformed the other models (R2 = 0.63 - 0.89, RMSE = 4.80 - 38.98), and successfully predicted both coagulant dosage and settled water turbidity simultaneously. The GAMTF model improved the prediction accuracy by considering the hidden interrelationships between features and the past states of features. The results demonstrate the first successful application of multivariate time series deep learning model, especially, a state-of-the-art graph attention-based model, using long-term data for decision-support systems in water treatment processes. © 2023","Attention-based mechanism; Big data; Coagulant; Deep learning; Prediction model; Time series","Big data; Decision support systems; Deep learning; Forecasting; Learning systems; Turbidity; Water treatment; Attention-based mechanism; Coagulant; Coagulant dosage; Deep learning; Learning models; Multivariate time series; Prediction modelling; Time series forecasting models; Times series; Water turbidity; Time series; coagulating agent; drinking water; coagulation; graphical method; machine learning; multivariate analysis; numerical model; prediction; time series analysis; Article; controlled study; decision making; deep learning; drug determination; electric conductivity; flocculation; flow rate; hydraulic retention time; machine learning; multiple linear regression analysis; outlier detection; predictive model; random forest; recurrent neural network; root mean squared error; time series analysis; turbidity; water quantity; water treatment; forecasting; procedures; time factor; water management; weather; Deep Learning; Forecasting; Machine Learning; Time Factors; Water Purification; Weather",,,,,"National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF: 2022R1A2C1009242","This study was supported in part by the National Research Foundation of Korea ( #2022R1A2C1009242 ).

However, it is argued that the practicality of deep learning methods is limited due to the lack of physical mechanics to explain the prediction results of water quality changes. A knowledge gap exists in rationalizing the deep learning results for water quality predictions. To address this gap, an interpretable deep learning framework was established to predict the spatiotemporal variations of water quality parameters in a large spatial region. Mereological, land-use, and socioeconomic variables were adopted to predict the daily variations of stream water quality parameters across 138 sub-catchments in a total of over 575,250 km2 in southern China. The coefficients of determination of chemical oxygen demand (COD), total phosphorus (TP), and total nitrogen (TN) predictions were over 0.80, suggesting a satisfactory prediction performance. The model performance in terms of prediction accuracy could be improved by involving land-use and socioeconomic predictors in addition to hydrological variables. The SHapley Additive exPlanations method used in this study was demonstrated to be effective for interpreting the prediction results by identifying the significant variables and reasoning their influencing directions on the variation of each water quality parameter. The air temperature, proportion of forest area, grain production, population density, and proportion of urban area in each sub-catchment as well as the accumulated rainfall within the previous 3 days were identified as the most significant variables affecting the variations of dissolved oxygen, COD, ammoniacal nitrogen(NH3–N), TN, TP, and turbidity in the stream water in the case area, respectively. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Deep learning; Interpretable; Large scale; Prediction; Water quality","ammonia; nitrogen; oxygen; phosphorus; river water; surface water; nitrogen; phosphorus; machine learning; prediction; streamwater; urban area; water quality; air temperature; Article; chemical oxygen demand; controlled study; deep learning; eutrophication; feed forward neural network; fluid balance; land use; large scale production; mean absolute error; mean squared error; population density; precipitation; socioeconomics; spatiotemporal analysis; stream (river); water monitoring; water pollution; China; environmental monitoring; procedures; river; water pollutant; water quality; China; China; Deep Learning; Environmental Monitoring; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Rivers; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Quality",,"ammonia, 14798-03-9, 51847-23-5, 7664-41-7; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; oxygen, 7782-44-7; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 51909035, 52179009, U2040206","This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 51909035 ), ( 52179009 ) and ( U2040206 ).",,,,,,,,,,"Aas, K., Jullum, M., Løland, A., Explaining individual predictions when features are dependent: more accurate approximations to Shapley values (2021) Artif.

Faculté SNVST, Université de Bouira, Bouira, 10000, Algeria","Consideration is now being given to the use of metal coagulants to remove turbidity from drinking water and wastewater. Concerns about the long-term impact of non-biodegradable sludge on human health and the potential contamination of aquatic systems are gaining popularity. Recently, alternative biocoagulants have been suggested to address these concerns. In this study, using a 1 M sodium chloride (NaCl) solution, the active coagulating agent was extracted from Pinus halepensis Mill. Seed, and used for the first time to remove Congo red dye, the influence of numerous factors on dye removal was evaluated in order to make comparisons with conventional coagulants. The application of biocoagulant was shown to be very successful, with coagulant dosages ranging from 3 to 12 mL L−1 achieving up to 80% dye removal and yielding 28 mL L−1 of sludge. It was also found that biocoagulant is extremely pH sensitive with an optimum operating pH of 3. Ferric chloride, on the other hand, achieved similar removal rate with higher sludge production (46 mL L−1) under the same conditions. A Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and proximate composition analysis were undertaken to determine qualitatively the potential active coagulant ingredient in the seeds and suggested the involvement of proteins in the coagulation-flocculation mechanism. The evaluation criteria of the Support vector machine_Gray wolf optimizer model in terms of statistical coefficients and errors reveals quite interesting results and demonstrates the performance of the model, with statistical coefficients close to 1 (R = 0.9998, R2 = 0.9995 and R2 adj = 0.9995) and minimal statistical errors (RMSE = 0.5813, MSE = 0.3379, EPM = 0 0.9808, ESP = 0.9677 and MAE = 0.2382). The study findings demonstrate that Pinus halepensis Mill. Seed extract might be a novel, environmentally friendly, and easily available coagulant for water and wastewater treatment. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Biocoagulant; Coagulation-flocculation mechanism; Congo red; Gray wolf optimizer; Pinus halepensis Mill. seed extract; Support vector machine","congo red; ferric chloride; Pinus halepensis extract; plant extract; sodium chloride; unclassified drug; congo red; coagulation; coniferous tree; drinking water; dye; machine learning; optimization; pollutant removal; seed; wastewater treatment; Article; chemical composition; controlled study; flocculation; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; machine learning; nonhuman; pH; pine; Pinus halepensis; plant seed; sludge; support vector machine; temperature; waste water management; water treatment; chemistry; human; plant seed; procedures; sewage; wastewater; water management; Congo Red; Flocculation; Humans; Pinus; Seeds; Sewage; Sodium Chloride; Wastewater; Water Purification",,"congo red, 573-58-0, 80701-77-5; ferric chloride, 7705-08-0; sodium chloride, 7647-14-5, 23724-87-0, 49658-21-1; Congo Red; Sewage; Sodium Chloride; Wastewater",,,,"The authors would like to thank everyone who assisted them with this project.",,,,,,,,,,"Abidin, Z.Z., Ismail, N., Yunus, R., Ahamad, I., Idris, A., A preliminary study on Jatropha curcas as coagulant in wastewater treatment (2011) Environ.

In rural areas, wastewater from the aquaculture ponds is discharged to the nearshore waters through artificial ditches causing lateral carbon export from the land to the ocean. Such flux may be meaningful in coastal carbon budgets since aquaculture is the hotspot of carbon sequestration and storage. To quantify the magnitude and temporal dynamics of lateral carbon export from aquaculture ponds, we used high-frequency in-situ monitoring of turbidity, fluorescent dissolved organic matter, etc. across different temporal scales. We measured water levels and velocity profiles in a ditch cross-section to obtain year-round water exchange. Carbon export was integrated from water fluxes and organic carbon concentrations. Our results suggested that aquaculture ponds were a source of particular organic carbon (POC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The net lateral flux of POC and DOC was 148 ± 38 kg yr−1 and 296 ± 18 kg yr−1. Temporally, the export of POC and DOC is influenced by both tides and wastewater discharge. Under the disturbance with aquaculture wastewater discharge, the mean DOC export in the ditch increased by 497 kg, which was 1.5 times that of the undisturbed; the mean POC export increased by 190 kg, which was 1.8 times that of the undisturbed. Thus, aquaculture activities can considerably disturb the coastal carbon balance by facilitating carbon-rich fluid exchange from onshore farms to nearshore estuaries. As aquaculture expands across Asia and the globe, this study provides important insights into the impacts of aquaculture on coastal carbon budgets. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Aquaculture farm; Dissolved organic carbon; Lateral carbon export; Particulate organic carbon; Tidal fluctuation","Aquaculture; Budget control; Dissolution; Lakes; Water levels; Aquaculture farm; Aquaculture ponds; Carbon export; Dissolved organic carbon; Hotspots; Lateral carbon export; Nearshores; Particulate organic carbon; Temporal dynamics; Tidal fluctuation; Organic carbon; carbon; dissolved organic matter; organic carbon; carbon; water; aquaculture; carbon budget; discharge; dissolved organic carbon; particulate organic carbon; temporal variation; wastewater; aquaculture; Article; artificial neural network; carbon balance; climate change; conductance; decision tree; ebb tide; estuary; hydrology; machine learning; nonhuman; pH; pond; random forest; sample size; seashore; seasonal variation; support vector machine; temperature; tide; turbidity; velocity; wastewater; water monitoring; water quality; aquaculture; environmental monitoring; Aquaculture; Carbon; Environmental Monitoring; Estuaries; Water",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; water, 7732-18-5; Carbon; Water",,,"Sun Yat-sen University, SYSU: 2021qntd15; Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, MAFRA: FREU2021-01; Guangdong Science and Technology Department, GDSTC: 2019ZT08G090; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC: 2021YFC3001000; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China ( 2021YFC3001000 ), the Fund of Key Laboratory of South China Sea Fishery Resources Exploitation & Utilization, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, China ( FREU2021-01 ), the Guangdong Provincial Department of Science and Technology , China ( 2019ZT08G090 ), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Sun Yat-sen University ( 2021qntd15 ).

This study examined and reported the applications of the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence in the phytoremediation of wastewater using Salvinia molesta plants. Water quality (WQ) indicators (total dissolved solids (TDS), temperature, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), and turbidity) of the S. molesta treatment system at a retention time of 24 h were measured using an Arduino IoT device. Finally, four machine learning tools (ML) were employed in modeling and evaluating the predicted concentration of the total dissolved solids after treatment (TDSt) of the water samples. Additionally, three nonlinear error ensemble methods were used to enhance the prediction accuracy of the TDSt models. The outcome obtained from the modeling and prediction of the TDSt depicted that the best results were observed at SVM-M1 with 0.9999, 0.0139, 1.0000, and 0.1177 for R2, MSE, R, and RMSE, respectively, at the training stage. While at the validation stage, the R2, MSE, R, and RMSE were recorded as 0.9986, 0.0356, 0.993, and 0.1887, respectively. Furthermore, the error ensemble techniques employed significantly outperformed the single models in terms of mean square error (MSE) and root mean square error (RMSE) for both training and validation, with 0.0014 and 0.0379, respectively. © 2023 by the authors.","computational analysis; energy; error ensemble methods; total dissolved solids; water quality forecasting",,,,,,"Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University, PNU: PNURSP2023R51; Universiti Tenaga Nasional","This research was funded by the Universiti Tenaga Nasional (UNITEN) BOLD Refresh Fund, Malaysia.

However, convolutional neural network-aided machine learning approaches are data-intensive, with model accuracy subject to the input image quality. Underwater imagery data acquisition, relatively high fish density, and water turbidity impart major challenges in acquiring high-quality imagery data. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of sensor selection, image quality, data size, imaging conditions, and pre-processing operations on the machine learning model accuracy for fish detection under RAS production conditions. An imaging platform (RASense1.0) was developed with four off-the-shelf sensors customized for underwater image acquisition. Data acquired from the imaging sensors under two light conditions (i.e., Ambient and Supplemental) were arranged in sets of 100 images and annotated as partial and whole fish. The annotated images were augmented and trained using a one-stage YOLOv5 model. There was a substantial improvement in mean average precision (mAP) and F1 score while increasing the size of the image datasets up to 700 images and 80 epochs. Similarly, image augmentation substantially improved model accuracy for smaller dataset models trained with less than 700 images. Beyond this, there was no improvement in mAP (∼86 %). Sensor selection significantly affected model precision, recall, and mAP; however, light conditions did not demonstrate a considerable effect on model accuracy. While comparing the performance of the one-stage YOLOv5 against a two-stage Faster R-CNN, both models performed similarly in terms of mAP scores; however, training time for the former was 6–14 times lower than the latter. © 2023 The Conservation Fund","Artificial intelligence; Machine learning; Precision aquaculture; RAS; Underwater imaging","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Data acquisition; Decision support systems; Deep learning; Fish; Fisheries; Image acquisition; Image quality; Underwater imaging; Water quality; Convolutional neural network; Data quality; Image data; Imagery data; Light conditions; Machine-learning; Modeling accuracy; Precision aquaculture; Recirculating aquaculture system; Sensor selection; Image enhancement; aquaculture; artificial neural network; data quality; detection method; fish; image analysis; imaging method; machine learning; numerical model; recirculating system; satellite imagery; sensor; underwater environment",,,,,"U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA: 59-8082-0-001","This study was supported by the USDA Agricultural Research Service agreement number 59-8082-0-001.

Most existing water quality models use mean error functions to maximize the predictability of water quality mean value. This paper describes a composite quantile regression neural network (CQRNN) model, which simultaneously estimates non-crossing regression quantiles by minimizing the composite quantile regression error function. This method can improve the prediction of extremes. This paper evaluates the performance of CQRNN for predicting extreme values of turbidity and total organic carbon (TOC) and compares with quantile regression (QR), linear regression (LR), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) in an application to the Hetch Hetchy Regional Water System, which is the primary water supply for San Francisco, CA. CQRNN is superior to QR, LR, and KNN for predicting the mean trend and extremes of turbidity and TOC, especially for the non-Gaussian turbidity data. The performance of CQRNN is the most stable relative to other methods over different training sample sizes. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Composite quantile regression neural network; Machine learning; Water quality; Water supply system","Forecasting; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Organic carbon; Regression analysis; Turbidity; Water quality; Water supply; Water supply systems; Composite quantile regression neural network; Error-function; Machine-learning; Model use; Performance; Quantile regression; Regression neural networks; Total Organic Carbon; Water quality modelling; Water-supply systems; Machine learning; environmental monitoring; prediction; regression analysis; total organic carbon; turbidity; water quality; water supply; article; artificial neural network; California; k nearest neighbor; linear regression analysis; machine learning; prediction; quantile regression; sample size; total organic carbon; turbidity; water quality; water supply; environmental monitoring; statistical model; water supply; California; San Francisco [California]; United States; Environmental Monitoring; Linear Models; Neural Networks, Computer; Water Quality; Water Supply",,,,,"Water Research Foundation, WRF: 4703","The authors acknowledge the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission for their financial, technical, and administrative assistance in funding, through the Water Research Foundation (WRF), the project through which this research belongs.",,,,,,,,,,"Abbaspour, K.C., Rouholahnejad, E., Vaghefi, S., Srinivasan, R., Yang, H., Kløve, B., A continental-scale hydrology and water quality model for Europe: Calibration and uncertainty of a high-resolution large-scale SWAT model (2015) Journal of Hydrology, 524, pp. 733-752; Ågren, A., Buffam, I., Bishop, K., Laudon, H., Modeling stream dissolved organic carbon concentrations during spring flood in the boreal forest: A simple empirical approach for regional predictions (2010) Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences, 115 (G1). , https://doi.org/10.1029/2009JG001013; Allaire, M., Wu, H., Lall, U., National trends in drinking water quality violations (2018) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 115 (9), pp. 2078-2083; Arhonditsis, G.B., Neumann, A., Shimoda, Y., Javed, A., Blukacz-Richards, A., Mugalingam, S., When can we declare a success?

Monitoring the urban river water quality indexes is a challenge in water quality evaluation. The purpose of this study was to propose a multi-source remote sensing water quality inversion method based on a small number of samples to solve the problem of scale inconsistency among multi-source remote sensing data, so as to achieve large-scale and efficient inversion of urban river water quality. Since there is a very important problem that the complex nonlinear relationships must be solved between simple ground point data and remote sensing data in water quality inversion, a novel self-optimizing machine learning monitoring method is proposed, which can automatically find the optimal parameters of the model from a small number of samples, and reduce the training time. Meanwhile, in order to strengthen the correlation between water quality parameters and remote sensing data, the feature enhancement method was used for generating the input data. Moreover, to solve the problem of the multi-source data quantity and quality, the spatial mapping method was used to achieve consistency in the water quality information since these data have different nonlinear characteristics. The experimental results show that for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images, the R2 of chlorophyll a (Chla), turbidity (TUB), and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) can reached 0.917, 0.877 and 0.846, respectively. Using a satellite image, the R2 of Chla, TUB, and NH3-N can reach 0.827, 0.679 and 0.779, respectively. This method provides a new way to realize the integration of air-space-ground monitoring of urban inland rivers in the future. © 2022 The Author(s)","Remote sensing; Self-optimization; Urban rivers; Water quality inversion","Ammonia; Antennas; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Rivers; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Chlorophyll a; Multi-Sources; Number of samples; Remote sensing data; Remote-sensing; River water quality; Self-optimization; Self-optimizing; Urban river; Water quality inversion; Water quality; environmental monitoring; machine learning; numerical method; remote sensing; river water; satellite data; self organizing map; unmanned vehicle; urban area; water quality",,,,,"202104b11020022; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 2008085QD188, 41901282, 41971311; Major Science and Technology Projects in Anhui Province: 201903a07020014","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 41901282 and 41971311), the National Natural Science Foundation of Anhui(grant number 2008085QD188), the Science and Technology Major Project of Anhui Province (grant No. 201903a07020014) and the International Science and Technology Cooperation Special(grant number 202104b11020022).",,,,,,,,,,"AlDahoul, N., Ahmed, A.N., Allawi, M.F., Sherif, M., Sefelnasr, A., Chau, K., El-Shafie, A., A comparison of machine learning models for suspended sediment load classification (2022) Eng.

Box 27272, Sharjah, United Arab Emirates","Seasonal variations (SVs) affect the population density (PD), fate, and fitness of pathogens in environmental water resources and the public health impacts. Therefore, this study is aimed at applying machine learning intelligence (MLI) to predict the impacts of SVs on P. shigelloides population density (PDP) in the aquatic milieu. Physicochemical events (PEs) and PDP from three rivers acquired via standard microbiological and instrumental techniques across seasons were fitted to MLI algorithms (linear regression (LR), multiple linear regression (MR), random forest (RF), gradient boosted machine (GBM), neural network (NN), K-nearest neighbour (KNN), boosted regression tree (BRT), extreme gradient boosting (XGB) regression, support vector regression (SVR), decision tree regression (DTR), M5 pruned regression (M5P), artificial neural network (ANN) regression (with one 10-node hidden layer (ANN10), two 6- and 4-node hidden layers (ANN64), and two 5- and 5-node hidden layers (ANN55)), and elastic net regression (ENR)) to assess the implications of the SVs of PEs on aquatic PDP. The results showed that SVs significantly influenced PDP and PEs in the water (p &lt; 0.0001), exhibiting a site-specific pattern. While MLI algorithms predicted PDP with differing absolute flux magnitudes for the contributing variables, DTR predicted the highest PDP value of 1.707 log unit, followed by XGB (1.637 log unit), but XGB (mean-squared-error (MSE) = 0.0025; root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) = 0.0501; R2 =0.998; medium absolute deviation (MAD) = 0.0275) outperformed other models in terms of regression metrics. Temperature and total suspended solids (TSS) ranked first and second as significant factors in predicting PDP in 53.3% (8/15) and 40% (6/15), respectively, of the models, based on the RMSE loss after permutations. Additionally, season ranked third among the 7 models, and turbidity (TBS) ranked fourth at 26.7% (4/15), as the primary significant factor for predicting PDP in the aquatic milieu. The results of this investigation demonstrated that MLI predictive modelling techniques can promisingly be exploited to complement the repetitive laboratory-based monitoring of PDP and other pathogens, especially in low-resource settings, in response to seasonal fluxes and can provide insights into the potential public health risks of emerging pathogens and TSS pollution (e.g., nanoparticles and micro- and nanoplastics) in the aquatic milieu. The model outputs provide low-cost and effective early warning information to assist watershed managers and fish farmers in making appropriate decisions about water resource protection, aquaculture management, and sustainable public health protection. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial neural network regression; Boosted regression tree; Decision tree regression; Extreme gradient boosted regression; Feature importance; Gradient boosted machine; K-nearest neighbours; M5 pruned regression; Machine intelligence; Multiple linear regression; Neural networks; Pathogen; Prediction; Predictive microbiology; Public health; Random forest; Support vector regression","Adaptive boosting; Decision trees; Forecasting; Learning systems; Logistic regression; Mean square error; Multilayer neural networks; Nearest neighbor search; Population distribution; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Public health; Random forests; Support vector regression; Water resources; Artificial neural network regression; Boosted regression trees; Decision tree regression; Extreme gradient boosted regression; Feature importance; Gradient boosted machine; K-near neighbor; M5 pruned regression; Machine intelligence; Multiple linear regressions; Nearest-neighbour; Neural-networks; Predictive micro-biology; Random forests; Support vector regressions; Multiple linear regression; dissolved oxygen; aquaculture; bacterium; machine learning; multiple regression; nearest neighbor analysis; pathogen; population density; public health; seasonal variation; Article; artificial neural network; autumn; biochemical oxygen demand; controlled study; decision tree; elastic net regression; electric conductivity; extreme gradient boosting regression; feature selection; k fold cross validation; k nearest neighbor; machine learning; multiple linear regression analysis; nonhuman; pH; physical chemistry; Plesiomonas shigelloides; population density; predictive model; predictive value; random forest; regression analysis; salinity; seasonal variation; South Africa; spring; summer; support vector machine; water temperature; winter; machine learning; Plesiomonas; population density; season; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Plesiomonas; Population Density; Seasons",,,,,"The World Academy of Sciences, TWAS: 116382, 99796; Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung, AvH; University of Sharjah, UOS; National Research Foundation, NRF; South African Medical Research Council, SAMRC: UFH/P790; Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF","We are grateful to the South African Medical Research Council ( UFH/P790 ), the National Research Foundation , The World Academy of Science (Grant Numbers: 99796 and 116382 ), the University of Sharjah, the African-German Network of Excellence in Science , the Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation for their financial support.",,,,,,,,,,"Abbott, S.L., Kokka, R.P., Janda, J.M., Laboratory investigations on the low pathogenic potential of Plesiomonas shigelloides (1991) J.

However, the accuracies of CV to detect turbidity is limited by several factors such as inferior image quality and adoptation of traditional machine learning (MsL). Several past studies have shown that the accuracy of CV to detect turbidity can be enhanced by employing image pre-processing and artificial intelligence (AI). Therefore, this study proposes a combined CV and convolution neural network (CNN) approach for turbid water classification in accordance with national water quality standards. A total of 71 turbid water samples in the range of 0–100 nephelometry turbidity units (NTU) were prepared from a mixture of 1000 NTU stock Formazine solution and distilled water. Digital images of water samples were acquired with the Asus Zenfone Go smartphone and nephelometry principle. Synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was employed for image pre-processing, synthesis, and augmentation. Classification models were developed with Keras CNN architecture and TensorFlow framework. Two national water standards referred to were Malaysia National Water Quality Standard Class I (NWQS-C1) and France Système D’évaluation de la Qualité des cours d’EAU bleu aptitude (SEQ-EAU-b). The proposed CV-CNN approach was successfully implemented with 94.34–98.42% accuracy. The accuracy of CNN was slightly higher when trained with color images (98.42%) than with grayscale images (94.34%). This study demonstrated that CV and CNN are excellent tools for water quality assessment, especially for classifying water turbidity. © 2023, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.","Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Convolutional neural network; Image pre-processing; Keras architecture; Nephelometry; SMOTE; Turbidity",,,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE: KPM FRGS/1/2018/STG02/UPM/02/5 (FRGS 5540079; Universiti Putra Malaysia, UPM","This research was funded by the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia (MOHE), grant number KPM FRGS/1/2018/STG02/UPM/02/5 (FRGS 5540079) and Institute for Mathematical Research (INSPEM), Universiti Putra Malaysia Computational Intelligence for Agricultural and Environmental Sustainability Initiative fund.",,,,,,,,,,"Drinking-water, https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/drinking-water#:~:text=Contaminated water and poor sanitation,individuals to preventable health risks; Lin, L., Yang, H., Xu, X., Effects of water pollution on human health and disease heterogeneity: a review (2022) Front.

The disastrous implications of poor water quality demand that there be a remedy that is both more expedient and more realistic. This research study examines a variety of supervised machine learning algorithms in order to identify the quality of the water. A variety of variables, such as the pH value, the hardness, the solids, the chloramines, the sulfates, the conductivity, the organic carbon, the trihalomethanes, the turbidity, and the potability of the water, are essential for determining the quality of the water. Random Forest (RF) and Decision Tree (DT) are used in order to ascertain the caliber of the water that is suitable for human consumption. The standard laboratory approach for testing the quality of water is one that takes a lot of time and may be somewhat expensive at times. In a very short length of time, the algorithms that are proposed in this study are able to provide an estimation of the quality of drinking water. DT has a height accuracy F1 score of 99%, whereas RF has a score of 87.86% and a precision of 82.36%. The difference in these two scores is due to the fact that DT's precision is lower. The suggested method demonstrates its potential for usage in real-time water quality monitoring systems by achieving appropriate accuracy with a minimal set of parameters. To prove the usefulness of this program, this is essential. © 2023 IEEE.","Decision Tree; Prediction of water quality; Random Forest; Supervised machine learning","Amines; Decision trees; Learning algorithms; Organic carbon; Potable water; Real time systems; Sulfur compounds; Supervised learning; Conventional approach; Drinking-water qualities; Hyper-parameter; Machine learning models; Parameters tuning; Prediction of water quality; Quality of water; Random forests; Supervised machine learning; Water quality analysis; Water quality",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.theworldcounts.com/challenges/planetearth/freshwater/deaths-from-dirty-water/story, Deaths from Dirty Water.

Based on the image data, a total of 51 modeling spectral indexes were obtained by constructing three forms of band combinations ranging from the difference index (DI), ratio index (RI), and normalization index (NDI) and combining six single-band spectral values. Through the partial least squares (PLS), random forest (RF), and lasso prediction models, six fitting models of water quality parameters were constructed: turbidity (Turb), suspended, substance (SS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP). After verifying the results and evaluating the accuracy, the following conclusions were drawn: (1) The inversion accuracy of the three types of models is generally the same—summer is better than spring, and winter is the worst. (2) Water quality parameter inversion model based on two kinds of machine learning algorithms has more prominent advantages than PLS. RF model has good performance in the inversion accuracy and generalization ability of water quality parameters in different seasons. (3) The prediction accuracy and stability of the model are positively correlated to a certain extent with the size of the standard deviation of sample values. To sum up, by using the multispectral image data acquired by UAV and adopting the prediction models built upon machine learning algorithms, water quality parameters in different seasons can be predicted in different degrees. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Lasso; Multiple regression; Partial least squares; Random forest; UAV multispectral; Urban rivers; Water pollution; Water quality parameters",,,,,,"E2020402086; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, NNSF, NNSFC: 42071246; Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province: D2021402007, E2020402006","This paper was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 42071246).

The alteration of the color of the water is reflective of the alteration of the water's properties and the degree to which it is suitable for use. Due to disasters like floods, tsunami in the last few years and water pollution has been an increasing problem. In world the intake of contaminated water causes 40% of deaths. Drinking unclean water is not safe and in order to reduce the issue to a level of extent, prediction of water quality can be done before consuming. The process used in water plants is based on the parameters pH, turbidity, temperature, hardness etc., of water using filtration and the water quality prediction can also be done using IOT by including both hardware and software. This project mainly comprises the primary level of water prediction using machine learning. Based on the color and quality of water the system predicts whether the given water sample is suitable for drinking or any further use. Tensorflow, Keras and CNN are used to train the model to forecast the water quality prediction. This project is cost-effective and works efficiently and can be used as immediate and initial level of water quality check since image processing tool is used. This model of water quality prediction can be checked using mobile captured and Google earth images of water samples. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Cost effectiveness; Forecasting; Image processing; Potable water; Water filtration; Water levels; Water pollution; Contaminated water; Cost work; Hardware and software; IS costs; Machine-learning; Quality of water; Water plant; Water properties; Water quality predictions; Water samples; Water quality",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Goel, Raheja Hemant, Pal Mahesh, Arun, Prediction of ground water indices using machine learning algorithms (2022) Water Practice and Technology, 17 (1), pp. 336-351; Ilić, M, Srdjević, Z, Srdjević, B, Water quality prediction based on Naïve Bayes algorithm (2022) Water Sci Technol, 8 (4), pp. 1027-1039; Haghiabi Amir, Haghiabi Amir, Hamzeh Nasrolahi Ali Heidar Parsaie Abbas Water quality prediction using machine learning methods Water Quality Research Journal, 53. , 1 3 13; (2021) Efficient Prediction of Water Quality Index (WQI) Using Machine Learning Algorithms; (2021) Water quality prediction and classification based on principal component regression and gradient boosting classifier approach; Nair, JP, Vijaya, MS, Predictive Models for River Water Quality using Machine Learning and Big Data Techniques-A Survey 2021 (2021) International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Smart Systems (ICAIS), p. 17471753; Yang, Y, Xiong, Q, Wu, C, Zou, Q, Yu, Y, Yi, H, Gao, M, A study on water quality prediction by a hybrid CNN-LSTM model with attention mechanism (2021) Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 28 (39). , 55129 55139; Chen, Y, Song, L, Liu, Y, Yang, L, Li, D, A review of the artificial neural network models for water quality prediction (2020) Applied Sciences, 10, p. 175776; Barzegar, R, Aalami, MT, Adamowski, J, Short-term water quality variable prediction using a hybrid CNN-LSTM deep learning model (2020) Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assessment, 34 (2), pp. 415-433; Baek, SS, Pyo, J, Chun, JA, Prediction of water level and water quality using a CNN-LSTM combined deep learning approach (2020) Water, 12 (12), p. 3399; Yan, J, Liu, J, Yu, Y, Xu, H, Water quality prediction in the luan river based on 1-DRCNN and bigru hybrid neural network model (2021) Water, 13 (9), p. 1273; Water quality prediction model based on GRU hybrid network (2019) 2019 Chinese Automation Congress (CAC), p. 18931898; Khan, MSI, Islam, N, Uddin, J, Islam, S, Nasir, MK, Water quality prediction and classification based on principal component regression and gradient boosting classifier approach (2022) Journal of King Saud University-Computer and Information Sciences, 34 (8), pp. 4773-4781; Hussain deen, A, Iqbal, S, Ambegoda, TD, Multi-Label Prototype Based Interpretable Machine Learning For Melanoma Detection (2016) International Journal of Advances in Signal And Image Sciences, 8 (1), pp. 40-53; Zhang, L, Jiang, Z, He, S, Duan, J, Wang, P, Zhou, T, Study on water quality prediction of urban reservoir by coupled CEEMDAN decomposition and LSTM neural network model (2022) Water Resources Management, 36 (10), pp. 3715-3735",,"Dwivedi R.K.Chauhan P.S.Jayamani E.Tiwari D.Gupta V.","Madhya Pradesh Council of Science and Technology;The Institutions of Engineers","Institute of Physics","2022 International Conference on Material Science, Mechanics and Technology, ICMMT 2022","23 December 2022 through 24 December 2022",,188735,17426588,,,,"English","J.

The survival of business and agriculture depends on freshwater. An essential step in managing freshwater assets is the evaluation of the quality of the water. Before using water for anything, including drinking, chemical spraying (pesticides, etc.), or animal hydration, it is crucial to assess its purity. The ecosystem and the general public's health are directly impacted by water quality. Therefore, analyzing and predicting water quality is necessary for both environmental and human protection. Machine learning can be used to analyze and predict the water quality based on the parameters like PH value, turbidity, hardness, conductivity, dissolved solids in water and other parameters. In this work, the water quality is predicted by giving the concentration of various parameters as input to machine learning algorithms and the water is classified as safe or unsafe for the usage of domestic purposes. © 2023 IEEE.","Conductivity; Hardness; Machine Learning; PH; Turbidity; Water Quality","Forecasting; Hardness; Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; pH; Potable water; Turbidity; Chemical spraying; Conductivity; Fresh Water; General publics; Human being; Living creatures; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; PH; Water quality predictions; Water quality",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mosavi, H.F.S., Choubin, B., Goodarzi, M., Dineva, A.A., Groundwater Salinity Susceptibility Mapping Using Classifier Ensemble and Bayesian Machine Learning Models (2020) IEEE Access, 8, pp. 145564-145576; Al-Sulttani, O., Al-Mukhtar, M., Roomi, A.B., Farooque, A.A., Khedher, K.M., Yaseen, Z.M., Proposition of New Ensemble Data-Intelligence Models for Surface Water Quality Prediction (2021) IEEE Access, 9, pp. 108527-108541; Lu, H., Ma, X., Hybrid decision tree-based machine learning models for short-term water quality prediction (2020) Chemosphere, 249, p. 126169. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.126169; Mohammed, H., Michel Tornyeviadzi, H., Seidu, R., Emulating process-based water quality modelling in water source reservoirs using machine learning (2022) Journal of Hydrology, 609. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.127675; Chen, B., Mu, X., Chen, P., Wang, B., Choi, J., Park, H., Xu, S., Yang, H., Machine learning-based inversion of water quality parameters in typical reach of the urban river by UAV multispectral data (2021) Ecological Indicators, 133. , https://doi.org/10.10167j.ecolind.2021.108434; Won Lee, H., Kim, M., Won Son, H., Min, B., Hyun Choi, J., Machine-learning-based water quality management of river with serial impoundments in the Republic of Korea (2022) Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies, 41. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.101069; Rana, M., Rahman, A., Dabrowski, J., Arnold, S., McCulloch, J., Pais, B., Machine learning approach to investigate the influence of water quality on aquatic livestock in freshwater ponds (2021) 5iosystems Engineering, 208. , https://doi.org/10.1016Zj.biosystemseng.2021.05.017; El Bilali, A., Taleb, A., Prediction of irrigation water quality parameters using machine learning models in a semi-arid environment (2020) Journal of the Saudi Society of Agricultural Sciences, 19 (7). , https://doi.org/10.1016/jJssas.2020.08.001; Grbcic, L., Druzeta, S., Mausa, G., Lipic, T., Vukic Lusic, D., Alvir, M., Lucin, I., Kranjcevic, L., Coastal water quality prediction based on machine learning with featureinterpretationand spatio-temporal analysis (2022) Environmental Modelling &.

Current water quality monitoring usually analyzes samples in laboratories, allowing only sporadic measurements, or uses immersed sensors in the wastewater, leading to clogging and sensor fouling resulting in expense due to intensive maintenance. Both techniques thus have serious limitations. Previous research showed that UV-Vis reflectance spectrometry can be used for non-contact monitoring of turbidity (TUR) and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), which are two key water quality indicators. Although spectrometer achieve high spectral resolution their limited spatial field of view is problematic for highly inhomogeneous surfaces as is the case wastewater In this study, we obtain beyond state-of-art measurement accuracies by combining machine learning techniques with increased spatial field-of-view Multi-Spectral Imaging (MSI) whilst substantially reducing the spectral resolution. We designed and built a dedicated setup with a monochromatic camera and an active illumination of thirteen LEDs covering the spectrum range of 200-700 nm. We acquired and calibrated data on 27 samples with different concentrations of TUR and COD. Machine learning regression models were trained and evaluated with the extracted spectra. We tested the Partial Least Square (PLS), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF). PLS regression performed best with excellent correlation coefficients (R2) of the 0.99 for TUR and 0.93 for COD. We obtained similar results with the SVM algorithm (R2 = 0.99 and 0.92), whilst RF had lower scores (R2 = 0.96 and 0.71). © 2023 SPIE.","Machine learning; Multi-spectral imaging; Wastewater; Water quality control","Chemical oxygen demand; Forestry; Hyperspectral imaging; Indicators (chemical); Learning systems; Pollution detection; Quality control; Regression analysis; Support vector machines; Water pollution; Chemical-oxygen demands; Field of views; Machine-learning; Multi-spectral; Multispectral imaging; Random forests; Spatial fields; Vision systems; Water quality control; Water quality monitoring; Water quality",,,,,,"The results of this research were funded by Innosuisse, CSEM SA and Photrack AG, with the collaboration of the EAWAG.",,,,,,,,,,"Rose, J., Cleaning the world's water: 'We are now more polluted than we have ever been (2016) The Guardian, , https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/31/cleaning-the-worlds-waterwe-are-now-more-polluted-than-we-have-ever-been, Aug [En ligne].

In this paper, a novel COD detection method called manifold time-varying spectrum detection (MTVSD) is proposed, which can accurately determine the COD concentration of wastewater in a short measurement period without the interference of suspended particles. To precisely determine COD components in both dissolved and undissolved states, the core ideas of traditional physical and chemical detection methods are combined in MTVSD, and the procedure of oxidant consumption and the decomposition of suspended particles are captured in a spectrum form (time-varying spectrum). Then, to accurately extract the inner structure of the time-varying spectrum, a novel machine learning method, structured manifold learning (SML), is invented based on the structural sparse representation and manifold learning, which can automatically extract spectrum components related to COD, solving the curse problem of high dimension, enhancing the detection accuracy and reducing the necessary detection speed. Based on the experimental results, our proposed method can more effectively eliminate the interference brought by turbidity and accurately detect the COD value (relative error < 10%) with a far shorter digestion time (within 5 min). © 2023 SPIE.","Absorption spectroscopy; Chemical oxygen demand detection; sparse learning; Time-varying spectrum; Water quality monitoring","Chemical detection; Chemical oxygen demand; E-learning; Learning systems; Machine components; Oxygen; Wastewater treatment; Water absorption; Water pollution; Water quality; Chemical oxygen demand detection; Chemical-oxygen demands; Detection methods; Manifold learning; Sparse learning; Spectra's; Spectrum detection; Suspended particles; Time varying spectrum; Water quality monitoring; Absorption spectroscopy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Charef, A., Ghauch, A., Baussand, P., Martin-Bouyer, M., Water quality monitoring using a smart sensing system (2000) Measurement, 28, pp. 219-224; Wang, C.

Turbidity, total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations are key water quality parameters (WQPs) that reflect the level of water eutrophication in inland waters. Due to the complex interaction effects between different water quality in urban rivers, the water quality retrieval models still have the problem of single input features and poor applicability. This paper proposed a robust feature selection method based on machine learning and utilized Sentinel-2 remote sensing images for water quality retrieval of Chan and Ba rivers in Xi’an City. The ReliefF and global sensitivity analysis (GSA) methods (ReliefF-GSA) were used to select the optimal feature combination from the potential feature dataset. Based on the optimal feature combination, Random Forest regression (RFR), LightGBM and XGboost models were constructed for the three WQPs retrieval, respectively. The optimal models were then used to invert the three WQPs and the spatial-temporal variation of WQPs from January 2021 to January 2022 was analysed. The results show that (1) The RelieF-GSA method is suitable for high-dimensional feature filtration and enables optimal feature selection for specific WQPs retrieval. It is revealed that the BOI index (black odour water index) is the key feature for the retrieval of turbidity and TN concentration. (2) The RFR model was found to be better than other models and more appropriate for Chan and Ba rivers, with coefficients of determination (R2) of 0.90, 0.89 and 0.81, respectively. (3) It was found that the water qualities in the Chan and Ba rivers have prominent seasonal characteristics. Turbidity and TP concentrations showed higher, while TN concentration showed relatively low in autumn. The method and conclusions of this paper can further provide a reference for WPQs retrieval in urban rivers. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Machine learning; Optimal feature selection;

Water is considered as a vital resource that has an impact on many facets of human health and existence. People who live in metropolitan areas are often concerned about the quality of the water as it is critical to monitor the quality of water. Water sample collection and laboratory analysis are time and resource-intensive processes. Analyzing water quality is a complicated subject because of the many variables that affect it. This concept is inextricably linked to the various purposes for which water is used. The goal of this study is to estimate water quality by acquiring several parameters, and using the machine learning method, Random Forest regression. In this case, the model uses parameters like pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, and others. © 2023 IEEE.","Decision Tree; Machine Learning; Random Forest regression; Water Quality; Web User Interface (UI)","Biochemical oxygen demand; Decision trees; Dissolved oxygen; Machine learning; Quality control; User interfaces; Human health; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Metropolitan area; Random forest regression; Random forests; Water quality analysis; Water quality predictions; Web user interface; Water quality",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Pal, O.K., The Quality of Drinkable Water using Machine Learning Techniques (2022) International Journal of Advanced Engineering Research and Science; Haghibi, A.H., Nasrolahi, A.H., Parsaie, A., Water quality prediction using machine learning (2018) Journal of Water quality research; Muhammad, S.Y., Makhtar, M., Rozaimee, A., Aziz, A.A., Jamal, A.A., Classification Model for Water Quality using Machine Learning Techniques (2015) International Journal of Software Engineering and Its Applications, 9 (6), pp. 45-52; Gakii, C., Jepkoech, J., A Classification Model for Water Quality Analysis Using Decision Tree (2019) European Journal of Computer Science and Information Technology, 7 (3), pp. 1-8; Ashwini, C., Singh, U.P., Pawar, E., Shristi, Water Quality Monitoring Using Machine Learning And IOT (2019) International journal of scientific & technology research, 8 (10); Ubah, J.I., Orakwe, L.C., Ogbu, K.N., Awu, J.I., Ahaneku, I.E., Chukwuma, E.C., Forecasting water quality parameters using artifcial neural network for irrigation purposes (2021) Nature.com/scientific-reports; Nasira, N., Kansal, A., Alshaltone, O., Barneih, F., Sameer, M., Shanableh, A., Al-Shammaá, A., Water quality classification using machine learning algorithms (2022) Journal of Water Process Engineering; Fu, Z., (2020) Water Quality Prediction Based on Machine Learning Techniques; Gazzaz, N.M., Yusoff, M.K., Aris, A.Z., Juahir, H., Ramli, M.F., Artificial neural network modeling of the water quality index for Kinta River (Malaysia) using water quality variables as predictors (2012) Marine Pollution Bulletin, 64 (11), pp. 2409-2420; Daud, M.K., Nafees, M., Ali, S., Rizwa, M., Bajwa, R.A., Shakoor, M.B., Arshad, M.U., Zhu, S.J., Drinking Water Quality Status and Contamination in Pakistan (2017) BioMedRes.

Longer periods with elevated air temperatures and more frequent occurrence of extreme precipitation are expected. It will lead to lower availability of water resources and more frequent catastrophic flooding. Greater spring utilization will further aggravate the occurrence of karst springs turbidity as well as coastal aquifers salinization. The negative impact on surface and recreational waters is also to be expected, especially in the case of inadequately built rainwater and urban wastewater collection systems. This paper presents the results of analyses of four pilot areas, three in Croatia: (a) Monitoring the water level and degrees of salinization of drinking water sources (Vrana Lake, Cres Island); (b) Water turbidity (Rijeka Municipality water resources); (c) Rainwater and wastewater impact on the bathing seawater quality (Šibenik); and one in Bosnia and Herzegovina: (d) The water supply in flood conditions (Maglaj Municipality). Descriptive statistical methods were used to analyse the observed data in the pilot areas studied. Two types of models were used in the implementation of modelling—a hydrological model based on balance estimates and machine learning models. These phenomena, along with other environmental factors (air, soil, food quality deterioration), can represent a negative impact on human health. Their monitoring requires a multidisciplinary approach. The aim of this paper was to assess the negative impacts of climate change on human health in the case studies described and to suggest possible ways to mitigate these negative impacts. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Drinking water; Floods; Microbial pollution; Public health; Recreational water; Salinization; Turbidity",,,,,,"Sveučilište u Rijeci, UNIRI: KK.05.1.1.02.0022, uniri-biomed-18-292, uniri-technic-18-298","Acknowledgements This work was financially supported by the: (1) University of Rijeka as part of the research project “Adaptation to the new EU Bathing Water Directive” (project code: uniri-biomed-18-292); (2) University of Rijeka as part of the research “Assessment of climate change impacts on hydrological stability of protected lake systems in Croatia‘s karst region” (project code: uniri-technic-18-298); (3) Management of Karst Coastal Aquifers Endangered by Climate Change (UKV), KK.05.1.1.02.0022; and (4) KLIMOD—Computer model of pollution, flooding and spreading of pollution in rivers and coastal sea areas, KK.05.1.1.02.0017.",,,,,,,,,,"Aydinol, I.T., F., Kanat, G., & Bayhan, H (2012) Sea Water Quality Assessment of Prince Islands’ Beaches in Istanbul.

HABs decrease water quality and are a significant health concern in surface water bodies. Near real-time monitoring of HABs in reservoirs and small water bodies is essential to understand the dynamics of turbidity and HAB formation. This study uses satellite imagery to remotely sense chlorophyll-a concentrations (chl-a), phycocyanin concentrations, and turbidity in two reservoirs, the Grand Lake O′ the Cherokees and Hudson Reservoir, OK, USA, to develop a tool for near real-time monitoring of HABs. Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery from 2013 to 2017 and from 2015 to 2020 were used to train and test three different models that include multiple regression, support vector regression (SVR), and random forest regression (RFR). Performance was assessed by comparing the three models to estimate chl-a, phycocyanin, and turbidity. The results showed that RFR achieved the best performance, with R2 values of 0.75, 0.82, and 0.79 for chl-a, turbidity, and phycocyanin, while multiple regression had R2 values of 0.29, 0.51, and 0.46 and SVR had R2 values of 0.58, 0.62, and 0.61 on the testing datasets, respectively. This paper examines the potential of the developed open-source satellite remote sensing tool for monitoring reservoirs in Oklahoma to assess spatial and temporal variations in surface water quality. © 2023 American Water Resources Association.","harmful algal blooms; inland water; lakes; machine learning; remote sensing; water quality monitoring","Ecosystems; Forestry; Lakes; Machine learning; Potable water; Regression analysis; Reservoirs (water); Satellite imagery; Turbidity; Water quality; Water supply; Chlorophyll-a concentration; Harmful algal blooms; Inland waters; Machine-learning; Multiple regressions; Near-real-time monitoring; Phycocyanin; Remote sensing tools; Remote-sensing; Water quality monitoring; Remote sensing",,,,,"2021OK006G; U.S. Department of the Interior, DOI; Bureau of Reclamation, USBR: 19AP00287","This study is based upon the work supported by the U.S. Department of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation under Grant #R19AP00287 and the U.S. Department of the Interior, Geological Survey Grant Number #2021OK006G.

Models were trained using parameters informed by Self-Organising Map analysis based on ten years of water quality sampling data, pipe data and discolouration customer contacts from a UK network supplying over 2.3 million households. Twenty combinations of input parameters (network conditions) and three learning algorithms (Random Forests, Support Vector Machines and RUSBoost Trees) were tested. The best performing model was found to be Random Forests with input parameters of iron, turbidity, 3-day Heterotrophic Plate Counts, and high priority dead ends per District Metered Area. Different exceedance levels were tested and prediction accuracies of above 70% were achieved for UK regulatory concentration of 200 µg/L. Predicted probabilities per network sub-region were used to provide relative risk ranking to inform proactive management and investment decisions. © 2023 Institute of Physics Publishing.

An IoT based novel SWG prototype has been developed and reported in this work. The SWG comprises sensors and devices that can continuously and remotely monitor the pressure, temperature, flow, pH, turbidity, etc., of the water being transported. Moreover, a novel 1-D CNN model has been developed by creating an artificial leak on the pipeline that takes input data points as a chunk of 5-minute time series to the network and gives output in leak detection, location and size estimation simultaneously. Further, the developed model is compared with other state of the art machine learning techniques and the proposed model is found better in terms of accuracy which is 94.32%, 91.91% and 89.85% for leak detection, size estimation and location respectively. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Convolution Neural Network (1-D CNN); Internet of Things (IoT); leak detection; leak location; leak size; programmable logic controller (PLC); smart water grid (SWG); Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)","artificial neural network; data acquisition; Internet; leakage; pipeline; smart grid; water supply",,,,,"Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute, CEERI; Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research","This work was supported by the Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR) and CSIR-Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute (CEERI).

An accurate model of photon propagation based on the Monte Carlo simulation is presented which accounts for the lens(es) photon refraction at the sensor interface and angular misalignment between the emitter and receiver. The results show that the ideal divergence of the beam of the emitter is around 15° for a 1 m transmission length, increasing to 22° for a shorter distance of 0.5 m but being independent of the water turbidity. In addition, it is concluded that a seven-lense scheme is approximately three times more tolerant to offset than a single lens. A random forest machine learning algorithm is also assessed for its suitability to estimate the offset and angle of the AUV in relation to the fixed sensor, based on the power distribution of each lens, in real time. The algorithm is able to estimate the offset and angular misalignment with a mean square error of 5 mm (6 mm) and 0.157 rad (0.174 rad) for a distance between the transmitter and receiver of 1 m and 0.5 m, respectively. © 2022 by the authors.","misalignment tolerance; Monte Carlo simulation; multiple-lens receiver; optical; propagation; random forest; underwater; wireless","Alignment; Autonomous underwater vehicles; Intelligent systems; Learning algorithms; Lenses; Machine learning; Mean square error; Optical communication; Photons; Underwater optical wireless communication; Angular misalignment; Autonomous underwater vehicles]; Lens receivers; Misalignment tolerance; Monte Carlo's simulation; Multiple-lens receiver; Optical-; Propagation; Random forests; Underwater; Monte Carlo methods",,,,,"Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT: 2020.06011, NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-022097; European Social Fund, ESF","This research was funded by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology, Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT), through the individual research grant 2020.06011.BD, co-financed by the European Social Fund through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme, Programa Operacional Regional do Norte (NORTE 2020).","The authors acknowledge the assistance and resources made available by TEC4SEA in support of this work.

This study presents the first regional-scale model for nowcasting the level of V.p in oysters in the marine environment by developing an ensemble modeling approach. The ensemble modeling approach involves the integration of genetic programming (GP) and deep artificial neural networks (DNN)-based modeling. The new approach was demonstrated by developing three GP-DNN ensemble models for predicting the V.p level in North Carolina, New Hampshire, and the combined region. Specifically, GP was employed to establish nonlinear functions between the V.p level and antecedent conditions of environmental variables. The nonlinear GP functions and current conditions of individual environmental variables were then utilized as inputs into a DNN model, forming a GP-DNN ensemble model. Modeling results indicated that the GP-DNN ensemble models were capable of predicting the V.p level with the correlation coefficient of 0.91, 0.90, and 0.80 for North Carolina, New Hampshire, and the combined region, respectively, demonstrating the impact of distinct environmental conditions in the local areas on accuracy of the combined regional-scale model. Sensitivity analysis results showed that sea surface temperature and sea surface salinity are the two most important environmental predictors for the abundance of V.p in oysters, followed by water level, pH, chlorophyll-a, and turbidity. The findings suggested that the GP-DNN ensemble models could be utilized as effective predictive tools for mitigating the V.p risk. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Antecedent environmental conditions;

Thus, effectively monitoring the water quality of coastal outfalls is the key to protecting the ecological environment. Satellite remote sensing provides an attractive way to monitor sewage discharge. Selecting the coastal areas of Zhejiang Province, China, as an example, this study proposes an innovative method for automatically detecting suspected sewage discharge from coastal outfalls based on high spatial resolution satellite imageries from Sentinel-2. According to the accumulated in situ observations, we established a training dataset of water spectra covering various optical water types from satellite-retrieved remote sensing reflectance (Rrs). Based on the clustering results from unsupervised classification and different spectral indices, a random forest (RF) classification model was established for the optical water type classification and detection of suspected sewage. The final classification covers 14 optical water types, with type 12 and type 14 corresponding to the high eutrophication water type and suspected sewage water type, respectively. The classification result of model training datasets exhibited high accuracy with only one misclassified sample. This model was evaluated by historical sewage discharge events that were verified by on-site observations and demonstrated that it could successfully recognize sewage discharge from coastal outfalls. In addition, this model has been operationally applied to automatically detect suspected sewage discharge in the coastal area of Zhejiang Province, China, and shows broad application value for coastal pollution supervision, management, and source analysis. © 2022 The Authors","Automatic recognition; Coastal pollution; Random forest; Satellite remote sensing; Sewage outfalls","Classification (of information); Clustering algorithms; Effluents; Optical remote sensing; Outfalls; Radiometers; River pollution; Rivers; Satellite imagery; Sewage; Water quality; Automatic recognition; Coastal area; Coastal pollution; Ecological environments; Optical water; Random forests; Satellite remote sensing; Sewage discharges; Sewage outfall; Water types; Decision trees; chlorophyll a; dissolved organic matter; phosphorus derivative; coastal zone; discharge; machine learning; satellite imagery; Sentinel; sewage; water pollution; water quality; algorithm; Article; chemical oxygen demand; China; chlorophyll content; environmental factor; eutrophication; machine learning; mathematical phenomena; nonhuman; oxygen consumption; particulate matter; quality control; random forest; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel-2; sewage; soil pollution; solar radiation; support vector machine; suspended particulate matter; turbidity; water quality; environmental monitoring; pollutant; procedures; river; water quality; China; Zhejiang; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Rivers; Sewage; Water Quality",,"chlorophyll a, 479-61-8; Environmental Pollutants; Sewage",,,"GML2019ZD0602; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China, MNR: YJJC2105; European Space Agency, ESA; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 41825014, 42176177; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF: 2017R52001, LR18D060001","We gratefully acknowledge the European Space Agency (ESA) Copernicus Open Access Hub for providing the Sentinel-2 data used in this study.

In particular, it is important to ensure effective removal of microbial substances during advanced wastewater treatment processes. However, most microbial indicators cannot be continuously monitored by online processes. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor treatment process performance based on surrogate measures which can be reliably and continuously monitored. For example, water quality data such as colour, turbidity and chemical oxygen demand (COD) can be measured quickly and easily. In this study, a combined ozonation-biological media filtration process (O3/BMF), was used to reduce microbial indicator concentration. After gathering water quality data and corresponding microbial indicator concentrations, we applied machine learning to develop models for predicting the amount of change in microbial indicator concentration following O3/BMF treatment. Three microbial indicators were studied, namely Clostridium perfringens, E. coli, and somatic coliphage. The most effective physico-chemical predictors for the removal of these microbial indicators were determined by means of mutual information. Associations between changes in the predictors' concentration during O3/BMF and the reduction of the microbial indicators were identified using a range of supervised learning algorithms including Naïve Bayes, random forest, support vector machines and generalised linear model. The impact of the type of prediction algorithm on prediction accuracy was investigated and the superior classifier was determined. Performance measures for microbial removal prediction were found to be superior for the support vector machines (SVM) classifier. Using SVM with a Gaussian kernel classifier, prediction accuracy for all microbial removal was above 75%. Moreover, other performance measures such as area under curve (AUC) and kappa statistics (KS) were higher in SVM compared to the other applied classifiers (AUC ≥ 0.80; KS ≥ 0.34). From this study, we have identified an objective and efficient method that can predict the effectiveness of the O3/BMF process in removing the three microbial indicators in water from a short list of commonly measured physico-chemical parameters. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Chemical oxygen demand; Forecasting; Forestry; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Ozone; Ozone water treatment; Ozonization; Wastewater treatment; Water quality; Kappa statistic; Machine learning models; Microbial activities; Microbial indicators; Microbial removal; Performance measure; Prediction accuracy; Process performance; Support vectors machine; Water quality data; Support vector machines; biofiltration; machine learning; microbial activity; numerical model; ozonation; prediction",,,,,"Australian Research Council, ARC: FT170100371","The project was supported by funding provided by the Australian Research Council (ARC) Future Fellowships Program, FT170100371.

The formation mechanism of the red tide is rather complicated; thus, red tide prediction and forecasting have long been a research hotspot around the globe. This study collected ocean monitoring data before and after the occurrence of red tides in Xiamen sea area from 2009 to 2017. The Pearson correlation coefficient method was used to obtain the associated factors of red tide occurrence, including water temperature, saturated dissolved oxygen, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll-aand potential of hydrogen. Then, we built a short-time red tide prediction model based on the combination of multiple feature factors. chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen, saturated dissolved oxygen, potential of hydrogen, water temperature, salinity, turbidity, wind speed, wind direction and Air pressure were used as the input variables, building a short-time prediction model based on the combination of multiple feature factors to forecast red tide in the next 6 h by using the monitoring data. The accuracy of different forecast models with different feature combinations was compared. Results show that the distinguishing factors which have the most significant influence on red tide prediction in Xiamen are chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen, saturated dissolved oxygen, potential of hydrogen, and water temperature. the convergence speed of the Gated Recurrence Unit (GRU) prediction model based on the main feature factor proposed in this paper was faster and obtained the expected result, and the accuracy rates of the buoys are above 92%. The research shows the feasibility to use GRU network model to predict the occurrence of red tide with multi-feature factors as input parameters. the paper provides an effective method for the red tide early warning in Xiamen sea area. © 2022","Correlation; GRU Network; Neural network; Prediction model; Red tide","Biochemical oxygen demand; Chlorophyll; Correlation methods; Dissolution; Forecasting; Hydrogen; Water temperature; Wind; Correlation; Gated recurrence unit network; Model-based OPC; Neural-networks; Prediction modelling; Red tide; Sea areas; Short-time predictions; Tide prediction; Water temperatures; Dissolved oxygen; chlorophyll a; dissolved oxygen; hydrogen; saturated dissolved oxygen; unclassified drug; artificial neural network; correlation; model; prediction; red tide; research; accuracy; air pressure; Article; China; controlled study; correlation coefficient; feasibility study; Gated Recurrence Unit; information processing; learning algorithm; long short term memory network; machine learning; monitoring; prediction; recurrent neural network; red tide; salinity; standardization; time series analysis; turbidity; water temperature; wind speed; China; Fujian; Xiamen",,"chlorophyll a, 479-61-8; hydrogen, 12385-13-6, 1333-74-0",,,"2021YFC3101600; 2017YFC1405300","The research was supported in part by the National key R&D plan (Grant 2017YFC1405300 ) and National R & D program (Grant 2021YFC3101600 ).","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research was supported in part by the National key R&D plan (Grant 2017YFC1405300 ) and National R & D program (Grant 2021YFC3101600 ).",,,,,,,,,"Anonymouse, Clame research sheeds new light on red tide (2006) Swa Technol., 47 (3). , 55-55; Bao-cai, Y., Review of deep learning (2015) J.

Data-driven modeling is an efficient technique that can be used to support such efforts. Our objective was to determine if in-stream concentrations of contaminants, nutrients—total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) —total suspended solids (TSS), dissolved oxygen (DO), and fecal coliform bacteria (FC) can be predicted satisfactorily using machine learning (ML) algorithms based on publicly available datasets. To achieve this objective, we evaluated four modeling scenarios, differing in terms of the required inputs (i.e., publicly available datasets (e.g., land-use/land cover)), antecedent conditions, and additional in-stream water quality observations (e.g., pH and turbidity). We implemented five ML algorithms—Support Vector Machines, Random Forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boost (XGB), ensemble RF-XGB, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) —and demonstrated our modeling framework in an inland stream—Bullfrog Creek, located near Tampa, Florida. The results showed that, while including additional water quality drivers improved overall model performance for all target constituents, TP, TN, DO, and TSS could still be predicted satisfactorily using only publicly available datasets (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency [NSE] > 0.75 and percent bias [PBIAS] < 10%), whereas FC could not (NSE < 0.49 and PBIAS >25%). Additionally, antecedent conditions slightly improved predictions and reduced the predictive uncertainty, particularly when paired with other water quality observations (6.9% increase in NSE for FC, and 2.7% for TP, TN, DO, and TSS). Also, comparable model performances of all water quality constituents in wet and dry seasons suggest minimal season-dependence of the predictions (<4% difference in NSE and < 10% difference in PBIAS). Our developed modeling framework is generic and can serve as a complementary tool for monitoring and predicting in-stream water quality constituents. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","In-stream water quality; Machine learning; Seasonality; Uncertainty quantification","Biochemical oxygen demand; Decision trees; Forecasting; Land use; Neural networks; Random forests; Rivers; Support vector machines; Water quality; Condition; Faecal coliform bacteria; In-stream water quality; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Seasonality; Total nitrogen; Total phosphorus; Total suspended solids; Uncertainty quantifications; Dissolved oxygen; dissolved oxygen; nitrogen; phosphorus; nitrogen; oxygen; phosphorus; concentration (composition); machine learning; nutrient; prediction; seasonality; streamwater; water quality; watershed; antecedent variable; Article; artificial neural network; coliform bacterium; concentration (parameter); fecal coliform; Florida; machine learning; nonhuman; nutrient; pH; prediction; quantitative analysis; random forest; seasonal variation; stream (river); support vector machine; suspended particulate matter; turbidity; uncertainty; water contamination; water quality; watershed; environmental monitoring; machine learning; procedures; river; Florida [United States]; Tampa; United States; Environmental Monitoring; Machine Learning; Nitrogen; Oxygen; Phosphorus; Rivers; Water Quality",,"nitrogen, 7727-37-9; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; oxygen, 7782-44-7; Nitrogen; Oxygen; Phosphorus",,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 2055347, 2100745; American Association of University Women, AAUW","This research was partially supported by the US National Science Foundation award numbers 2100745 and 2055347 .

Although various machine learning (ML) models have been developed for coastal water quality estimation using remote sensing data, the performance of these models has significant uncertainties when applied to regional scales. To address this issue, an ensemble ML-based model was developed in this study. The ensemble ML model was applied to estimate chlorophyll-a (Chla), turbidity, and dissolved oxygen (DO) based on Sentinel-2 satellite images in Shenzhen Bay, China. The optimal input features for each WQP were selected from eight spectral bands and seven spectral indices. A local explanation strategy termed Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) was employed to quantify contributions of each feature to model outputs. In addition, the impacts of three climate factors on the variation of each WQP were analyzed. The results suggested that the ensemble ML models have satisfied performance for Chla (errors = 1.7%), turbidity (errors = 1.5%) and DO estimation (errors = 0.02%). Band 3 (B3) has the highest positive contribution to Chla estimation, while Band Ration Index2 (BR2) has the highest negative contribution to turbidity estimation, and Band 7 (B7) has the highest positive contribution to DO estimation. The spatial patterns of the three WQPs revealed that the water quality deterioration in Shenzhen Bay was mainly influenced by input of terrestrial pollutants from the estuary. Correlation analysis demonstrated that air temperature (Temp) and average air pressure (AAP) exhibited the closest relationship with Chla. DO showed the strongest negative correlation with Temp, while turbidity was not sensitive to Temp, average wind speed (AWS), and AAP. Overall, the ensemble ML model proposed in this study provides an accurate and practical method for long-term Chla, turbidity, and DO estimation in coastal waters. © 2022","Coastal area; Ensemble model; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Water quality","chlorophyll a; dissolved oxygen; polyethylene; surface water; chlorophyll; oxygen; coastal zone; ensemble forecasting; machine learning; remote sensing; satellite imagery; water quality; air pressure; air temperature; Article; climate; coastal waters; correlation analysis; estuary; eutrophication; feature selection; information processing; machine learning; meteorological phenomena; population growth; remote sensing; satellite imagery; seashore; turbidity; urbanization; water depth; water monitoring; water pollution; water sampling; wind speed; environmental monitoring; machine learning; pollutant; procedures; remote sensing; water quality; China; Guangdong; Shenzhen; Chlorophyll; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Machine Learning; Oxygen; Remote Sensing Technology; Water Quality",,"chlorophyll a, 479-61-8; polyethylene, 9002-88-4; chlorophyll, 1406-65-1, 15611-43-5; oxygen, 7782-44-7; Chlorophyll; Environmental Pollutants; Oxygen",,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC: 2016YFC04007009","The authors acknowledge the financial support of the National Key R&D Program of China for this research under grant number 2016YFC04007009 .

Thus, in this study, a retrieval algorithm was developed to predict chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) based on a large amount of in situ measurements and Landsat 8 remote sensing images. Random Forest (RF) machine learning was conducted to identify the relationship between environmental indicators (pH, turbidity, conductivity, total dissolved solids and water temperature), Chl-a, TN and TP. The results showed that the NIR/R Binomial algorithm for Chl-a estimation presented appreciable reliability with R2 of 0.7429, root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.2089 and mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of 15.33%. The water quality variation in the PRE showed a characteristic of overall improvement and regional deterioration with average concentrations of 7.28 μg/L, 1.15 mg/L and 0.12 mg/L for Chl-a, TN, and TP respectively. Turbidity and pH were identified as the most important indicators to explain Chl-a (52.86%, 39.91%), TN (52.38%, 40.57%) and TP (55.23%, 40.03%) variation. Agricultural pollution was the main pollution source due to the intensive application of fertilizer and increased field size. Besides, land use patterns (e.g., increasing farmland but decreasing forest) greatly influenced water quality from 2010 to 2020. Moreover, light limitation caused by high turbidity reduced the algae productivity and further lowered the Chl-a concentration. The driving factors for regional water quality variations were anthropologically dominated and supplemented by climate change.

To effectively improve the performance of filtration systems, it is necessary to determine an optimal operating condition beyond conventional methods of periodic and empirical operation. Herein, this paper proposes an effective approach to finding an optimal operating strategy using deep reinforcement learning (DRL), particularly for an ultrafiltration (UF) system. Deep learning was developed to represent the UF system utilizing a long-short term memory and provided an environment for DRL. DRL was designed to control three actions; operating pressure, cleaning time, and cleaning concentration. Ultimately, DRL proposed the UF system to actively change the operating pressure and cleaning conditions over time toward better water productivity and operating efficiency. DRL denoted ∼20.9% of specific energy consumption can be reduced by increasing average water flux (39.5–43.7 L m−2 h−1) and reducing operating pressure (0.617–0.540 bar). Moreover, the optimal action of DRL was reasonable to achieve better performance beyond the conventional operation. Crucially, this study demonstrated that due to the nature of DRL, the approach is tractable for engineering systems that have structurally complex relationships among operating conditions and resultants. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Chemical cleaning; Deep reinforcement learning; Machine learning; Optimization; Ultrafiltration","Cost engineering; Deep learning; Energy utilization; Learning systems; Operating costs; Reinforcement learning; Ultrafiltration; Condition; Deep reinforcement learning; Engineering efficiency; Filtration systems; Machine-learning; Operating pressure; Optimal operating conditions; Optimisations; Performance; Reinforcement learnings; Chemical cleaning; alginic acid; bentonite; humic acid; infusorial earth; polyvinylidene fluoride; sea water; sodium hydroxide; water; chemical analysis; machine learning; operations technology; optimization; reinforcement; ultrafiltration; water flux; Article; biofouling; chemical cleaning; cleaning; concentration (parameter); deep learning; engineering; environmental policy; information processing; long short term memory network; pressure; process optimization; productivity; reinforcement learning (machine learning); turbidity; ultrafiltration; artificial membrane; filtration; human; procedures; water management; Filtration; Humans; Membranes, Artificial; Ultrafiltration; Water; Water Purification",,"alginic acid, 28961-37-7, 29894-36-8, 9005-32-7, 9005-38-3; bentonite, 1302-78-9; humic acid, 1415-93-6; infusorial earth, 61790-53-2; polyvinylidene fluoride, 24937-79-9; sodium hydroxide, 1310-73-2; water, 7732-18-5; Membranes, Artificial; Water",,,"Ministry of Environment, MOE: 146845; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP: 2020R1A4A1019568; Korea Environmental Industry and Technology Institute, KEITI; Korea Institute of Science and Technology, KIST: 2E31932; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government ( MSIT ) (No. 2020R1A4A1019568 ) and was supported by the institutional program of KIST ( 2E31932 ) and was supported by Korea Environment Industry & Technology Institute ( KEITI ) through Industrial Facilities & Infrastructure (Desalination) Research Program, funded by Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE) (146845).",,,,,,,,,,"Bacchin, P., Aimar, P., Sanchez, V., Model for colloidal fouling of membranes (1995) AIChE J., 41, pp. 368-376; Bonny, T., Kashkash, M., Ahmed, F., An efficient deep reinforcement machine learning-based control reverse osmosis system for water desalination (2022) Desalination, 522; Bourgeous, K.N., Darby, J.L., Tchobanoglous, G., Ultrafiltration of wastewater: effects of particles, mode of operation, and backwash effectiveness (2001) Water Res., 35, pp. 77-90; Cha, D., Park, S., Kim, M.S., Kim, T., Hong, S.W., Cho, K.H., Lee, C., Prediction of oxidant exposures and micropollutant abatement during ozonation using a machine learning method (2020) Environ.

Their capacity in modeling complex problems confirmed and motivated researchers to explore their merit in different disciplines. The use of two AI-models (probabilistic neural network and multilayer perceptron neural network) for the estimation of two different water quality indicators (namely dissolved oxygen (DO) and five days biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5)) were reported in this study. The WQ parameters estimation based on four input modelling scenarios was adopted. Monthly water quality parameters data for the duration from January 2006 to December 2015 were used as the input data for the building of the prediction model. The proposed modelling was established utilizing many physical and chemical variables, such as turbidity, calcium (Ca), pH, temperature (T), total dissolved solids (TDS), Sulfate (SO4), total suspended solids (TSS), and alkalinity as the input variables. The proposed models were evaluated for performance using different statistical metrics and the evaluation results showed that the performance of the proposed models in terms of the estimation accuracy increases with the addition of more input variables in some cases. The performances of PNN model were superior to MLPNN model with estimation both DO and BOD parameters. The study concluded that the PNN model is a good tool for estimating the WQ parameters. The optimal evaluation indicators for PNN in predicting BOD are (R2 = 0.93, RMSE = 0.231 and MAE = 0.197). The best performance indicators for PNN in predicting Do are (R2 = 0.94, RMSE = 0.222 and MAE = 0.175). © 2022 by the authors.","data engineering; input combinations; Iraq region; machine learning; surface water quality",,,,,,"Universiti Teknologi MARA, UiTM","The authors would like to thank the Institute for Big Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence (IBDAAI), Kompleks Al-Khawarizmi, Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM), 40450 Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia, for the support fund in publishing this paper.

Automatic fish sizing with a non-invasive approach involves working with different views of the fish's body and changing environments, being the stage of extraction of individuals in the image and the quality of the segmentation essential to obtain good sizing measurements. The goal of this work is to improve the results and functionality achieved in our previous studies with conventional segmentation methods based on local thresholding, where different limitations were observed, mainly the necessity of parameters tuning and a high computational cost. The number of detections must also increase significantly to increase the reliability of the statistical results. An approach using convolutional neural networks is proposed for fish detection and segmentation in videos acquired under real conditions, which eliminates the engineering procedure of parameter adjustment and generalises the solution for fish segmentation to deal with different environmental conditions (illumination and water turbidity) and background variability. The results show that the fish sizing procedure is enhanced thanks to the improvement in fish image instance segmentation. In particular, the number of fish measurements increases by up to 2.45 times when using Mask R-CNN and the PointRend module, thus increasing the accuracy of the fish length estimation, and the number of measurements per minute of computing time increases by up to 3.5 times. Our proposal obtains highly accurate fish length estimations in juvenile bluefin tuna based on a stereoscopic vision system and a deformable model of the fish's silhouette, both from the ventral and dorsal perspectives. An important improvement is achieved by applying CNN, as demonstrated by the number of segmented instances, the time required to segment an instance, and the accuracy of the fish sizing achieved. © 2022 The Authors","Automatic fish sizing; Biomass estimation; Computer vision; Convolutional neural networks; Fishery management; Underwater stereo vision","Computer vision; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Fisheries; Image enhancement; Image segmentation; Stereo image processing; Stereo vision; Automatic fish sizing; Biomass estimation; Bluefin tuna; Convolutional neural network; Fish length; Fisheries management; Impact evaluation; Length estimation; Underwater stereo; Underwater stereo vision; Fish; artificial neural network; environmental conditions; juvenile; machine learning; tuna fishery",,,,,"PRTR-C17; Generalitat Valenciana, GVA: AICO/2021/016, PAID-10-19; Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea, EHU: IDIFEDER/2018/025","This study forms part of the ThinkInAzul programme and was supported by MCIN with funding from European Union NextGenerationEU ( PRTR-C17.

In terms of national, regional, and local health and development, this is critical. Water and sanitation improvements have been found to provide a positive return on investment in certain areas, since the reductions in health risks and medical expenses much surpass the costs of making the improvements. To check whether that water is safe or not we have some parameters which need to be checked like pH value which ranges from 6.52 - 6.83 and Hardness, Chloramines, Sulphate, Conductivity, Organic carbon, Trihalomethanes, Turbidity, and at last portability. When we acquire a result of 1, we know that the water is safe to drink. If we get a portability value of 0 it is not safe for water consumption Before checking the quality of water, we need to collect all water bodies' images from Google earth maps and mask them and check their pot ability.The project involves data analysis of the different parameters which are involved in checking the portability of water with proper dataset using data processing methods. Random Forest, Decision Tree and other machine learning algorithms are used to make predictions. With the use of VGG image Annotator and leakage location estimate algorithms such as cross correlation of sinusoidal waves and water bodies are masked out of water distribution pipes. © 2022 Little Lion Scientific.

Meanwhile, the safety of available freshwater is threatened by the massive generation of waste from increasing domestic and industrial activities. The need for continuous assessment of the quality of the environmental water available has become a crucial research concern. The conventional techniques commonly used are not sufficient to meet the expanding demand for real-time, rapid, low-cost, reliable, and sensitive water quality monitoring (WQM). The use of wireless sensor networks (WSN) has been proposed by various researchers as a sustainable substitute for the traditional processes of monitoring water quality. In this work, an array of the literature on the practical applications of the networks in the assessment of vital water quality parameters such as pH, turbidity, temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), chlorine content, etc., were surveyed and analyzed. Various technologies such as machine learning, blockchain, internet of things (IoT), deep reconstruction model, etc., were incorporated with WSN for real-time monitoring of water quality, data acquisition, and reporting for a broad range of water bodies. The survey shows that the networks are comparatively affordable and allow remote, real-time, and sensitive measurement of these parameters with minimal human involvement. The use of a low-power wide area network (LPWAN) was also introduced to solve a major problem of power supply often associated with the use of WSN. Recent developments also showed the capacity of WSN to assess simultaneously multiple water quality parameters from several locations using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). However, the networks rely on established parameters to indicate a compromise in water quality, but in most cases, fail to identify which pollutant species are responsible. © 2022 The Author(s).

This study proposes a smart soft sensor using various ML algorithms to control and predict the Coagulation and Flocculation Process (CFP). Optimizing and predicting the behaviour of a CFP is difficult due to its non-linear and complex behaviour. Therefore, ML computations is a proper method to overcome this challenge. However, one of the challenges of ML studies is the lack of sufficient data which we overcome by using an 8-year database of experiments. For prediction, this study compares different ML methods, including Random Tree, Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Quinlan's M5 algorithm with regression function (M5P), Linear Regression (LR), Simple LR, Gaussian method, Decision Stump method, Smola and Scholkopf's Sequential Minimal Optimization algorithm with LR (SMOreg), and the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). Also, for optimization of the studied system, Central Composite Design designed the experimental data with the Response Surface Methodology (CCD-RSM). The most significant factors in turbidity removal are related to FeCl3 dosage, and slow mixing speed with &lt; 0.0001 and 0.005 P-values. The present research findings show that the maximum removal efficiency of 92% is predicted using CCD-RSM under the optimal condition. In addition, ANFIS and RF models with R2 of 0.96 and 0.92, have shown the highest accuracy levels for removing water turbidity. Finally, a Petri-Net model establishes a Conceptual model to intelligently conduct managerial insights for water treatments. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","CCD-RSM; Coagulation modelling; Machine learning; Petri-net; Turbidity; Water quality","Chlorine compounds; Coagulation; Decision trees; Flocculation; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Iron compounds; Machine learning; Optimization; Ostwald ripening; Petri nets; Turbidity; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference; CCD-RSM; Coagulation models; Coagulation process; Flocculation process; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Neuro-fuzzy inference systems; Soft sensors; Sustainable operations; Water quality",,,,,,"All authors read and approved the final manuscript.",,,,,,,,,,"Abba, S.I., Nourani, V., Elkiran, G., Multi-parametric modeling of water treatment plant using AI-based non-linear ensemble (2019) J.

Based on parameters such as temperature, pH, turbidity, KMnO4, NH4, Mn, Al and Fe, the calculation of WQI was conducted, while for the WQI prediction models, along with the mentioned parameters, O2, TOC and UV254 were additionally used. Four models were built to predict WQI with a time step of one, five, ten, and fifteen days in advance, in order to improve treatment processes of the DWTP regarding the changes in raw water quality in the Butoniga reservoir. Therefore, obtained models can help in the optimization of treatment processes, which depend on the quality of raw water, and overall, in the sustainability of the treatment plant. Results showed that the obtained correlation coefficients for all models are relatively high and, as expected, decrease as the number of prediction days increases; conversely, the number of rules, and related linear equations, depends on the parameters set in the WEKA modelling software, which are set to default settings which give the highest values of correlation coefficient (R) for each model and the optimal number of rules. In addition, all models have high accuracy compared to the measured data, with a good prediction of the peak values. Therefore, the obtained models, through the prediction of WQI, can help to manage the treatment processes of the DWTP, which depend on the quality of raw water in the Butoniga reservoir. © 2022 by the authors.","Butoniga reservoir; drinking water treatment plant; machine learning; prediction models; treatment processes improvement; water quality; water quality index","correlation; drinking water; numerical model; optimization; prediction; software; water quality; water treatment; water treatment plant; Istria",,,,,"uniri-tehnic-18-129, uniri-tehnic-18-54; Hrvatska Zaklada za Znanost, HRZZ: IP-2018-01-1645","This research has been fully supported by the University of Rijeka under projects: “Sustainable River Basin Management by Implementation of Innovative Methodologies, Approaches and Tools” (uniri-tehnic-18-129) and “Hydrology of Water Resources and Identification of Flood and Mudflow Risk in Karst” (uniri-tehnic-18-54).

A better understanding of bilgewater emulsions is required for proper wastewater management to meet discharge regulations. In this study, we developed 360 emulsion samples based on commonly used Navy cleaner data and previous bilgewater composition studies. Oil value (OV) was obtained from image analysis of oil/creaming layer and validated by oil separation (OS) which was experimentally determined using a gravimetric method. OV (%) showed good agreement with OS (%), indicating that a simple image-based parameter can be used for emulsion stability prediction model development. An ANOVA analysis was conducted of the five variables (Cleaner, Salinity, Suspended Solids [SS], pH, and Temperature) that significantly impacted estimates of OV, finding that the Cleaner, Salinity, and SS variables were statistically significant (p < 0.05), while pH and Temperature were not. In general, most cleaners showed improved oil separation with salt additions. Novel machine learning (ML)-based predictive models of both classification and regression for bilgewater emulsion stability were then developed using OV. For classification, the random forest (RF) classifiers achieved the most accurate prediction with F1-score of 0.8224, while in regression-based models the decision tree (DT) regressor showed the highest prediction of emulsion stability with the average mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.1611. Turbidity also showed a good emulsion prediction with RF regressor (MAE of 0.0559) and RF classifier (F1-score of 0.9338). One predictor variable removal test showed that Salinity, SS, and Temperature are the most impactful variables in the developed models. This is the first study to use image processing and machine learning for the prediction of oil separation for the application of bilgewater assessment within the marine sector. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Bilgewater; Coalescence; Emulsion stability; Image processing; Machine learning; Oil-in-water emulsions","Decision trees; Emulsification; Emulsions; Forecasting; Image processing; Ostwald ripening; Stability; Bilgewater; Emulsion stability; Images processing; Machine-learning; Oil separation; Oil-in-water; Oil-in-water emulsion; Random forest classifier; Suspended solids; Water emulsion; Machine learning; coalescence; emulsion; image processing; machine learning; wastewater treatment; analysis of variance; article; classifier; decision tree; emulsion; image analysis; image processing; machine learning; major clinical study; mean absolute error; navy; pH; prediction; predictive model; predictor variable; random forest; salinity; suspended particulate matter; turbidity; chemistry; emulsion; machine learning; temperature; wastewater; oil; Emulsions; Machine Learning; Oils; Temperature; Waste Water",,"Emulsions; Oils; Waste Water",,,"Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program, SERDP: WP18-1114","This work was supported by the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) under project number WP18-1114 .",,,,,,,,,,"Akaike, H., A new look at the statistical model identification (1974) IEEE Trans.

And on this basis, it explores the feasibility of using hyperspectral monitoring technology instead of laboratory physical and chemical index test and evaluates the prediction effect of inversion model on water quality change. So as to be more convenient, more economical and extensive monitoring methods for water quality monitoring of urban internal river are provided. This paper takes the water samples collected in Fuyang River in downtown Handan as the research object and obtains original spectral data of the samples by the ASD FieldSpec 4 field hyperspectral spectrometer. After the smoothing filter pretreatment by the Savitzky-Golay (SG) method and specified mathematical transformations, the modeling spectral indicators of various water quality parameters are selected and determined by calculating the maximum mean of absolute values for correlation coefficients of various spectral indicators and measured values in the wavelength range from 400 to 950 nm. By introducing partial least squares (PLS), random forest (RF), and Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), six water quality parameter fitting models were constructed including turbidity (Turb), suspended substance (SS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), NH4-N, total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP), which are also testified and evaluated through hyperspectral data. The results show that different spectral transformation methods highlight different information inversion effects. The first derivative of reciprocal logarithm of spectral data after SG smoothing has a good modeling effect on four water quality parameters including Turb, COD, NH4-N, and TP; and the first derivative of smoothed spectral data has a good modeling effect on both water quality parameters of SS and TN. Among the three models, the PLS model has a good prediction effect, with the Rp2 for COD, TN, and TP ranging from 0.74 to 0.80, while that for Turb and SS shows relatively poorer prediction effect, followed by even worse effect on HN4-H. Both machine learning algorithms of RF and Lasso have respectively obtained the best prediction models for different water quality parameters. The Lasso model has a Rp2 value above 0.8 for water body organic pollutants COD, TN, and TP, and the decrease value for Rc2 and Rp2 is below 0.1, which indicates that the model has high prediction accuracy and strong generalization ability, but the results of SS and NH4-N do not meet the expected accuracy. In the inversion model of RF for COD, Rp2 is higher than Rc2, which shows excellent performance, and has certain prediction ability for SS and NH4-N. The RF model and Lasso model complement each other effectively in applicability and prediction accuracy. Compared with the traditional regression model PLS, machine learning has obvious overall advantages, making it more suitable for classified inversion prediction of urban river water quality parameters. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Ground hyper-spectrum;

In this study, we compared two machine learning methods to predict water quality parameters, such as total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and turbidity (TUR), for 97 watersheds located in the Southeast Atlantic region of the USA. The modeling framework incorporates multiple climate and watershed variables (characteristics) that often control the water quality indicators in different landscapes. Three techniques, such as stepwise regression (SR), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), and genetic algorithm (GA), are implemented to identify appropriate predictors out of 28 climate and catchment-related variables. The selected predictors were then used to develop the Random Forest (RF) and Boosted regression tree (BRT) models for water quality predictions in selected watersheds. The results highlighted that while both algorithms provided reasonable results (based on statistical metrics), the RF algorithm was easier to train and robust to model overfitting. Partial dependence plots highlighted the complex and nonlinear relationships between the individual predictors and the water quality indicators. The thresholds obtained from partial dependence plots showed that the median values of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) in streams increase significantly when the percentage of urban and agricultural lands is above 40% and 43% of the watershed area, respectively. Furthermore, when soil hydraulic conductivity increases, the reduction in runoff results in decreased Turbidity levels in streams. Therefore, identifying the key watershed characteristics and their critical thresholds can help watershed managers create appropriate regulations for managing and sustaining healthy stream ecosystems. Besides, the forecasting models can improve water quality predictions in ungauged watersheds. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Boosted regression trees; Machine learning algorithms; Random forests; Water quality","Catchments; Decision trees; Ecosystems; Forecasting; Forestry; Genetic algorithms; Machine learning; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Random forests; Regression analysis; Rivers; Sustainable development; Turbidity; Watersheds; Boosted regression trees; Machine learning algorithms; Random forest modeling; Random forests; Stream ecosystems; Stream water quality; Total nitrogen; Total phosphorus; Water quality indicators; Water quality predictions; Water quality; genetic algorithm; machine learning; prediction; regression analysis; streamwater; turbidity; water quality; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Southeast); United States",,,,,,"The authors would like to thank the Ministry of Education in Saudi Arabia for providing funding through a student scholarship.",,,,,,,,,,"Agouridis, C.T., Workman, S.R., Warner, R.C., Jennings, G.D., Livestock grazing management impacts on stream water quality: a review 1 (2005) JAWRA J Am Water Resour Assoc, 41 (3), pp. 591-606; Allan, J.D., Landscapes and riverscapes: the influence of land use on stream ecosystems (2004) Annu Rev Ecol Evol Syst, 35, pp. 257-284; Alnahit, A.O., Mishra, A.K., Khan, A.A., Quantifying climate, streamflow, and watershed control on water quality across Southeastern US watersheds (2020) Sci Total Environ; Alpaydin, E., (2020) Introduction to machine learning, , MIT Press, Cambridge; Amit, Y., Geman, D., Shape quantization and recognition with randomized trees (1997) Neural Comput, 9 (7), pp. 1545-1588; Arlot, S., Celisse, A., A survey of cross-validation procedures for model selection (2010) Stat Surv, 4, pp. 40-79; Arnold, J.G., Moriasi, D.N., Gassman, P.W., Abbaspour, K.C., White, M.J., Srinivasan, R., Santhi, C., van Liew, M.W., SWAT: Model use, calibration, and validation (2012) Trans ASABE, 55 (4), pp. 1491-1508; Bardsley, W.E., Vetrova, V., Liu, S., Toward creating simpler hydrological models: A LASSO subset selection approach (2015) Environ Model Softw, 72, pp. 33-43; Breiman, L., Random forests (2001) Mach Learn, 45 (1), pp. 5-32; Bucak, T., Trolle, D., Tavşanoğlu, Ü.N., Çakıroğlu, A.İ., Özen, A., Jeppesen, E., Beklioğlu, M., Modeling the effects of climatic and land use changes on phytoplankton and water quality of the largest Turkish freshwater lake: Lake Beyşehir (2018) Sci Total Environ, 621, pp. 802-816. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC2sXhvFWmtr%2FK; Bui, D.T., Khosravi, K., Tiefenbacher, J., Nguyen, H., Kazakis, N., Improving prediction of water quality indices using novel hybrid machine-learning algorithms (2020) Sci Total Environ, 721, p. 137612. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BB3cXkslGiu7s%3D; Castela, J., Ferreira, V., Graça, M.A.S., Evaluation of stream ecological integrity using litter decomposition and benthic invertebrates (2008) Environ Pollut, 153 (2), pp. 440-449. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD1cXkvFWhtrY%3D; Castrillo, M., García, Á.L., Estimation of high frequency nutrient concentrations from water quality surrogates using machine learning methods (2020) Water Res, 172, p. 115490. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BB3cXht1yksLw%3D; Charlton, R., (2007) Fundamentals of fluvial geomorphology, , Routledge, Milton Park; Chen, K., Chen, H., Zhou, C., Huang, Y., Qi, X., Shen, R., Liu, F., Wang, J., Comparative analysis of surface water quality prediction performance and identification of key water parameters using different machine learning models based on big data (2020) Water Res, 171, p. 115454. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BB3cXnvFWisw%3D%3D; Correll, D.L., Phosphorus: a rate limiting nutrient in surface waters (1999) Poult Sci, 78 (5), pp. 674-682. , COI: 1:STN:280:DyaK1M3ktl2luw%3D%3D; Cui, B., He, Q., Gu, B., Bai, J., Liu, X., (2016) China’s coastal wetlands: understanding environmental changes and human impacts for management and conservation, , Springer, Berlin; Daly, C., Halbleib, M., Smith, J.I., Gibson, W.P., Doggett, M.K., Taylor, G.H., Curtis, J., Pasteris, P.P., Physiographically sensitive mapping of climatological temperature and precipitation across the conterminous United States (2008) Int J Climatol A J R Meteorol Soc, 28 (15), pp. 2031-2064; De’ath, G., Fabricius, K.E., Classification and regression trees: a powerful yet simple technique for ecological data analysis (2000) Ecology, 81 (11), pp. 3178-3192; Dillon, P.J., Kirchner, W.B., The effects of geology and land use on the export of phosphorus from watersheds (1975) Water Res, 9 (2), pp. 135-148. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DyaE2MXhtFGruro%3D; Elith, J., Leathwick, J.R., Hastie, T., A working guide to boosted regression trees (2008) J Anim Ecol, 77 (4), pp. 802-813. , COI: 1:STN:280:DC%2BD1cvgsFOqsQ%3D%3D; (2014) Arcgis 10.3. 1 for Desktop.

Tenant aquaculture enables individuals irrespective of their profession to grow fishes locally in a little space. However, there are challenges facing aquaculture such as the availability of water, how to monitor and manage water quality, and more seriously, the problem of absence of dataset with which the farmer can use as a guide for fish breeding. Aquaponics is a system that combines conventional aquaculture with hydroponics (the method of growing plants in water i.e. soilless farming of crops). It uses these two technologies in a symbiotic combination in which the plant uses the waste from the fish as food while at the same time filtering the water for immediate re-use by the fish. This helps to solve the problem of frequent change of water. An Internet of Things (IoT) system consisting of an ESP-32 microcontroller which controls water quality sensors in aquaponics fish ponds was designed and developed for automatic data collection. The sensors include temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, ammonia and nitrate sensors. The IoT system reads water quality data and uploads the same to the cloud in real time. The dataset is visualized in the cloud and downloaded for the purposes of data analytics and decision-making. We present the dataset in this paper. The dataset will be very useful to the agriculture, aquaculture, data science and machine learning communities. The insights such dataset will provide when subjected to machine learning and data analytics will be very useful to fish farmers, informing them when to change the pond water, what stocking density to apply, provide knowledge about feed conversion ratios, and in predict the growth rate and patterns of their fishes. © 2022","Aquaculture; aquaponics; Catfish; IoT; Microcontroller; Sensors",,,,,,"0326-S-001","This work was supported by the Meridian Institute under the Lacuna Fund for Agricultural Dataset 2020 [Grant No.: 0326-S-001, 2020 ], at 105 Village Place, Dillon, Colorado 80435, United States.",,,,,,,,,,"Udanor, C.N., Ossai, N.I., Ogbuokiri, B.O., Nweke, O.E., Ugwoke, P.O., Ome, U.K., A Pilot Implementation of a Remote IoT Sensors for Aquaponics System Datasets Acquisition (2021), Springer Nature In Press; Mohammed, H.A., Al-Mejibi, I., Smart monitoring and controlling system to enhance fish production with minimum cost (2018) J.

In this study, in-situ (n = 144,912) and laboratory-dispersed (n = 64) particle size measurements collected using laser diffractometry were compared from nine rivers discharging along 800 km of GBR coastline to determine the extent of in-situ flocculation. Environmental controls on in-situ particle size were investigated using decision tree algorithms trained on coeval measurements of salinity, shear rate, and turbidity. Comparison of in-situ and dispersed particle size measurements demonstrate that suspended-sediment across all catchments flocculated into larger aggregates with an order-of-magnitude difference in median particle size between in-situ (D50v = 132 μm, σ = 60 μm for all data) and dispersed (D50v = 15 μm, σ = 11 μm for all data) particles. Machine learning algorithms showed excellent promise predicting various measures of in-situ particle size. Model validation R2 ranged from 0.72 to 0.99, inclusion of catchment as a categorical variable only marginally (&lt;1%) increased R2. These results demonstrate that flocculation is prevalent across all rivers surveyed and that hydrodynamics are more important than inter-catchment differences (e.g., differences in climate, geology, or land-use). Implications of widespread flocculation on the determination of end-of-catchment sediments loads and subsequent dispersal patterns across continental shelves are discussed to inform the refinement and monitoring of GBR sediment targets. © 2022.

Machine learning models have shown great potentials for estimating water quality with the development of online sensors. However, accurate estimation is challenging because of uncertainties related to models used and data input. In this study, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and back-propagation neural network (BPNN) models are developed with three sampling frequency datasets (i.e., 4-hourly, daily, and weekly) and five conventional indicators (i.e., water temperature (WT), hydrogen ion concentration (pH), electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO), and turbidity (TUR)) as surrogates to individually estimate riverine total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) in a small-scale coastal watershed. The results show that the RF model outperforms the SVM and BPNN machine learning models in terms of estimative performance, which explains much of the variation in TP (79 ± 1.3%), TN (84 ± 0.9%), and NH4+-N (75 ± 1.3%), when using the 4-hourly sampling frequency dataset. The higher sampling frequency would help the RF obtain a significantly better performance for the three nutrient estimation measures (4-hourly &gt; daily &gt; weekly) for R2 and NSE values. WT, EC, and TUR were the three key input indicators for nutrient estimations in RF. Our study highlights the importance of high-frequency data as input to machine learning model development. The RF model is shown to be viable for riverine nutrient estimation in small-scale watersheds of important local water security. © 2022 Chen et al.

Digital technologies, such as big data, Internet of Things (IoT), and machine learning (ML) have a significant role and capability to meet the goal. Water quality analysis in any region is critical to identify and understand the standard of water quality and the quality of water is analyzed based on water quality parameters (WQP). Currently, water pollution and the scarcity of water are two major concerns in the region of Uttarakhand, and the analysis of water before it is supplied for human consumption has gained attention. In this study, a big data analytics framework is proposed to analyze the water quality parameters of 13 districts of Uttarakhand and find the correlation among the parameters with the assimilation of IoT and ML. During the analysis, statistical and fractal methods are implemented to understand the anomalies between the water quality parameters in 13 districts of Uttarakhand. The variation in WQP is analyzed using a random forest (RF) model, and the dataset is segmented location wise and the mean, mode, standard deviation, median, kurtosis, and skewness of time series datasets are examined. The mean of the parameters is adjusted with the coefficient of variation based on the standard values of each parameter. The turbidity in almost all the experimental sites has a normal distribution, with the lowest mean value (0.352 mg/L) and highest (11.9 mg/L) in the Pauri Garhwal and Almora districts, respectively. The pH of the water samples is observed to be in the standard range in all the experimental sites, with average and median values being nearly identical, at 7.189 and 7.20, respectively. However, the pH mode is 0.25. The Cl− concentration varies with mean values from the lowest (0.46 mg/L) to the highest (35.2 mg/L) over the experimental sites, i.e., the Bageshwar and Rudraprayag districts, respectively. Based on the analysis, it was concluded that the water samples were found to be safe to drink and in healthy condition in almost all the districts of the state Uttarakhand, except for the Haridwar district, where some increase in contaminants was observed. © 2022 by the authors.

To avoid a process interruption, proper planning of these resources is imperative. Therefore, a scientifically based, practical tool to predict and forecast relevant water parameters will help plant operators to know in advance which chemicals and methods are necessary for polluted water management and treatment. This study aims to develop a system to predict and forecast mine water parameters using electrical conductivity (EC) and pH of mining influenced water from the Acid Mine Drainage treatment plant in Springs, South Africa as an example. Three machine learning algorithms, namely random forest regression, gradient boosting regression and artificial neural network (ANN) were compared to find the best learning model to be used for predictive analysis. These models were developed using historical data of the years 2016 to 2021. Input variables of the models are turbidity, total dissolved solids, SO4 and Fe, with EC and pH being the target outputs. Results of the models have been compared with the measured data on the basis of the mean absolute error and root mean square error. The results show that random forest and gradient boosting models perform better than the ANN model, and thus these models were deployed as a web application. The Long Short-Term Memory technique was used to forecast the input parameter values for 60 days, and these values were used to get the future values for EC and pH for the same period.

In fact, more than 60% of the human body is made up of water. Our bodies consume water in every cell, in the different organisms and in the tissues. Hence, water allows stabilization of the body temperature and guarantees the normal functioning of the other bodily activities. Nevertheless, in recent years, water pollution has become a serious problem affecting water quality. Therefore, to design a model that predicts water quality is nowadays very important to control water pollution, as well as to alert users in case of poor quality detection. Motivated by these reasons, in this study, we take the advantages of machine learning algorithms to develop a model that is capable of predicting the water quality index and then the water quality class. The method we propose is based on four water parameters: temperature, pH, turbidity and coliforms. The use of the multiple regression algorithms has proven to be important and effective in predicting the water quality index. In addition, the adoption of the artificial neural network provides the most highly efficient way to classify the water quality. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence; Data analysis; Machine learning; Prediction; Water quality","algorithm; artificial neural network; design; detection method; prediction; water pollution; water quality",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ahmed, U., Mumtaz, R., Anwar, H., Efficient water quality prediction using supervised machine learning (2019) Water, 11 (11), p. 2210; Aldhyani, T.H.H., Al-Yaari, M., Alkahtani, H., Maashi, M., Water quality prediction using artificial intelligence algorithms (2020) Appl Bionics Biomech; Asadollah, S.B.H.S., Sharafati, A., Motta, D., Yaseen, Z.M., River water quality index prediction and uncertainty analysis: a comparative study of machine learning models (2021) J Environ Chem Eng, 9 (1); Azrour, M., Farhaoui, Y., Ouanan, M., Guezzaz, A., SPIT detection in telephony over IP using K-means algorithm (2019) Proc Comput Sci, 148, pp. 542-551; Bekesiene, S., Meidute-Kavaliauskiene, I., Vasiliauskiene, V., Accurate prediction of concentration changes in ozone as an air pollutant by multiple linear regression and artificial neural networks (2021) Mathematics, 9 (4), p. 356; Ciulla, G., D’Amico, A., Building energy performance forecasting: a multiple linear regression approach (2019) Appl Energy, 253; Deng, T., Chau, K.-W., Duan, H.-F., Machine learning based marine water quality prediction for coastal hydro-environment management (2021) J Environ Manag, 284; Dezfooli, D., Hosseini-Moghari, S.-M., Ebrahimi, K., Araghinejad, S., Classification of water quality status based on minimum quality parameters: application of machine learning techniques (2018) Model Earth Syst Environ; El Bilali, A., Taleb, A., Prediction of irrigation water quality parameters using machine learning models in a semi-arid environment (2020) J Saudi Soc Agric Sci, 19 (7), pp. 439-451; Ewaid, S.H., Water quality evaluation of Al-Gharraf river by two water quality indices (2017) Appl Water Sci, 7 (7), pp. 3759-3765; Griffiths, O., Henderson, H., Simpson, M., (2010) Environmental Health Practitioner Manual: (Common Wealth of Australia)., , https://ww2.health.wa.gov.au/~/media/Files/Corporate/general-documents/Environmental-health/Aboriginal-environmental-health/Environmental-Health-Practitioner-Manual.pdf, Accessed 10 Aug 2021; Guezzaz, A., Asimi, Y., Azrour, M., Asimi, A., Mathematical validation of proposed machine learning classifier for heterogeneous traffic and anomaly detection (2021) Big Data Min Anal, 4 (1), pp. 18-24; Guezzaz, A., Asimi, A., Asimi, Y., Azrour, M., Benkirane, S., A distributed intrusion detection approach based on machine leaning techniques for a cloud security (2021) Intelligent systems in big data, semantic web and machine learning.

The citation has now been inserted in “3.5. The Role of Drone Data Derived Vegetation Indices and Machine Algorithms in Remote Sensing Water Quality and Quantity” as reference [60] and should read: “Numerous vegetation indices were derived from drone remotely sensed data for characterising surface water quality and quantity. The most widely used sections of the electromagnetic spectrum in detecting water quality parameters were the visible section (blue and green) and the NIR wavebands. In this regard, vegetation indices such as the red and near-infrared (NIR), Surface Algal Bloom Index (SABI) [60], two-band algorithm (2BDA) [26], NDVI, and Green NDV [33], as well as band combinations and differencing such as (R+NIR/G) were used mostly in characterising chlorophyll content as well as TSS. As was suggested in many studies, the combination of sensitive spectral variables with robust and efficient algorithms produce accurate models. This study noted that algorithms such as linear regression (LR), image differencing, matching pixel-by-pixel (mpp), artificial neural networks (ANN), and the Manning–Strickler and adaptive cosine estimator were utilised in characterising mostly water quality parameters (Figure 9). The mpp-based algorithms were also detected during the bibliometric analysis illustrated in Figure 3 (red cluster). Despite being a parametric estimator, LR was the most widely used algorithm because it is simple to implement [61] across various statistical platforms ranging from Microsoft Excel to R statistics. Since LR is a parametric statistic, it requires the data to suit specific assumptions such as normality that are often a challenge to attain. In this regard, there is a need for more efforts in assessing the utility of robust machine learning algorithms such as stochastic gradient boosting, random forest, and the ANN in mapping water quality based on drone remotely sensed data (Figure 10).” For the references after 60, should be revised like below: Original 60 change to 61; Original 61 change to 62; Original 62 change to 63; Original 63 change to 64; Original 64 change to 65; Original 65 change to 66; Original 66 change to 67; Original 67 change to 68; Original 68 change to 69; Original 69 change to 70; Original 70 change to 71; Original 71 change to 72; Original 72 change to 73; Original 73 change to 74; Original 74 change to 75; Original 75 change to 76; Original 76 change to 77; Original 77 change to 78; Original 78 change to 79. Which the corresponding citations in the main text should be changed like below: “4.1. Evolution of Drone Technology Applications in Remote Sensing Water Quality and Quantity, the second paragraph.” Meanwhile, results showed that more efforts from the community of practice were widely exerted towards mapping water quality in relation to water quantity. Specifically, only fourteen studies assessed the level of water, whereas thirty-seven studies assessed water quality parameters based on drone remotely sensed data [44,47–49,62–72]. A few examples of studies that mapped water levels included Ridolfi and Manciola [63], who used a method that was based on the Ground Control Points (GCPs) to detect water levels, where water level values were measured using drone-derived data. Meanwhile, Adongo et al. [64] assessed the utility of undertaking bathymetric surveys combined with geographic information systems (GIS) functionalities in remotely determining the reservoir volume of nine irrigation dams in three northern regions of Ghana. On the other hand, the majority of water quality-related studies that were conducted based on drone remotely sensed data, principally mapped and monitored the chlorophyll content [30,32,33,37,38] and turbidity in lakes, ponds, and dams (Figure 5b) [34–36]. This trend was also revealed through the bibliometric analysis illustrated in Figure 3. Other water quality parameters that were of interest include the chemical oxygen demand (COD) [26,35,73], Secchi disk depth (ZSD) [26,34,74], total nitrogen [35], total phosphorous [35,72], conductivity [24–26,73], water quality index [73], pH [27,75], total suspended solids (TSS) [28,29,76], dissolved Oxygen (DO) [75,77], and turbidity [35,48], in order of importance illustrated by their frequency in the literature. “4.2. Challenges in the Application of Drone Technologies with Special Reference to the Global South, the first paragraph.” The major challenge associated with many regions is the statutory regulations that govern the operation of UAVs [77–79]. In many countries, there are still stringent restrictions regarding where and how UAVs are supposed to be operated [16]. In some countries of the global south, the take-off mass, the maximum altitude of flight, and the operational areas of drones tend to be regulated [16]. For instance, the South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) stipulates that remotely piloted aircraft or toy aircraft should not be operated at 50 m or closer to any person or group of persons. It states that remotely piloted aircraft or toy aircraft must not be operated at an altitude higher than 45.72 m (150 ft) from the ground unless approved by the Director of Civil Aviation of the SACAA. Remotely piloted aircraft or toy aircraft weighing more than 7 kg should be operated only if approved by the SACAA (http://www.caa.co.za/pages/rpas/remotely%20piloted%20aircraft%20 systems.aspx, accessed on 19 July 2021). The size of the UAV which is often associated with its batteries, engine efficiency, load, and type of UAV (fixed-wing or multi-rotor) tends to determine the length of time it can spend on a single flight plan and the size of the area it can cover [46,79]. In this regard, the regulation on the mass of UAV at taking off tends to indirectly restrict the areal extent that can be covered as well as the size of the camera to be mounted for research purposes, amongst other uses [16,68]. © 2022, MDPI.

Advanced monitoring techniques such as machine learning (ML) methods have been developed for an accurate, reliable, and cost-effective prediction of BOD. This study investigated the effectiveness of four stand-alone ML algorithms, namely, artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting machine (GBM), and six novel hybrid algorithms, namely, RF-SVM, ANN-SVM, GBM-SVM, RF-ANN, GBM-ANN, and RF-GBM, in predicting BOD of the Buriganga river system of Bangladesh. The feature importance analysis of RF algorithm indicated that chemical oxygen demand (COD), total dissolved solids (TDS), conductivity, total solids (TS), suspended solids (SS), and turbidity are the most influential parameters for predicting BOD5. The significance of this study is the application of the novel hybrid models that resulted in higher prediction success; RF-SVM with the highest R2 value (0.908). The employed novel hybrid ML models can be particularly useful for efficient and systematic data management, water pollution control, and prevention in developing countries such as Bangladesh. Practitioner Points: Investigated the efficiency of four stand-alone and six novel hybrid ML models for predicting BOD in a river of Bangladesh. The significance of this study is the application of the six novel hybrid models that resulted in higher prediction success. The best three prediction models were RF-SVM, ANN-SVM, and GBM-SVM with a prediction success of 91%, 89.6%, and 88.8% respectively. ML models indicated COD, conductivity, TDS, TS, SS, and turbidity as the most influential variables for predicting BOD.

Various algorithms have been applied to predict the population and presence of indicator microorganisms and pathogens in agricultural water sources. The purpose of this study is to improve the Salmonella prediction success of deep feed-forward neural network (DFNN) in agricultural surface waters with a determined correlation value based on selected features. Datasets were collected from six agricultural ponds in Central Florida. The most successful physicochemical and environmental features were selected by the gain ratio for the prediction of generic Escherichia coli population with machine learning algorithms (decision tree, random forest, support vector machine). Salmonella prediction success of DFNN was evaluated with dataset including selected environmental and physicochemical features combined with predicted E. coli populations with and without correlation value. The performance of correlation value was evaluated with all possible mathematical dataset combinations (nCr) of six ponds. The higher accuracy performances (%) were achieved through DFNN analyses with correlation value between 88.89 and 98.41 compared to values with no correlation value from 83.68 to 96.99 for all dataset combinations. The findings emphasize the success of determined correlation value for the prediction of Salmonella presence in agricultural surface waters. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Correlation value; Deep neural network; Random forest; Salmonella; Support vector machine","Agriculture; Decision trees; Deep neural networks; Escherichia coli; Feedforward neural networks; Forecasting; Lakes; Random forests; Salmonella; Agricultural water; Computer based tools; Correlation value; Environmental features; Feed forward neural net works; Performance; Physicochemical features; Random forests; Support vectors machine; Water source; Support vector machines; surface water; algorithm; artificial neural network; bacterium; correlation; pond; prediction; support vector machine; water quality; agriculture; air temperature; Article; bacterial gene; bacterium culture; conductance; correlation analysis; data accuracy; decision tree; deep neural network; Escherichia coli; feature selection; invA; machine learning; mathematical model; measurement precision; nerve cell network; nonhuman; pH; physical chemistry; pond; prediction; random forest; Salmonella; support vector machine; turbidity; water temperature; environmental monitoring; Escherichia coli; Salmonella; Florida [United States]; United States; Environmental Monitoring; Escherichia coli; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Salmonella",,,,,"Çankiri Karatekin Üniversitesi","This study was supported by Çankırı Karatekin University.",,,,,,,,,,"Abimbola, O.P., Mittelstet, A.R., Messer, T.L., Berry, E.D., Bartelt-Hunt, S.L., Hansen, S.P., Predicting Escherichia coli loads in cascading dams with machine learning: An integration of hydrometeorology, animal density and grazing pattern (2020) Science of the Total Environment, 722; Aljarah, I., Faris, H., Mirjalili, S., Optimizing connection weights in neural networks using the whale optimization algorithm (2018) Soft Computing, 22 (1), pp. 1-15; Barzegar, R., Aalami, M.T., Adamowski, J., Short-term water quality variable prediction using a hybrid CNN–LSTM deep learning model (2020) Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assessment, 34, pp. 415-433; Benjamin, L., Atwill, E.R., Jay-Russell, M., Cooley, M., Carychao, D., Gorski, L., Mandrell, R.E., Occurrence of generic Escherichia coli, E.

The increase of natural and anthropogenic events in coastal regions poses the marine ecosystem in danger day by day. Therefore, the prediction of marine water quality indicators is essential. Turbidity is a key indicator of marine water quality, whose prediction is difficult due to its non-linear time series behavior. Therefore, the objective of the present study is to predict turbidity in the marine environment of Hong Kong using Machine Learning (ML) approach. The artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), and Long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN) have been used as ML tools in the marine environment. The ML model prediction results were compared and the obtained results suggest that the LSTM-RNN model outperforms the ANN and SVR model results with an accuracy of 88.45%. The neural network-based approaches give better prediction accuracy over the SVR model in this study. Thus, it can be concluded that the neural network-based algorithm results can be used to monitor water quality parameters in the marine environment. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Machine learning; Marine environment; Turbidity; Water quality",,,,,,"Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, IIT KGP; Sponsored Research and Industrial Consultancy, SRIC","We thank Mr. Shaik Firoj (Ph.D. student of IIT Kharagpur) for their assistance in writing manuscript.

Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) has been examined as a viable alternative for hydrographic surveys for the past few decades to reduce the data acquisition efforts in coastal regions and augmentation of periodic updating of Electronic Navigational Charts (ENCs). The previous studies have applied SDB algorithms in less complex waters due to the limitations of SDB algorithms in turbid and varying shallow waters. This paper analyses three different medium-resolution satellite imagery data to derive bathymetry in a navigably very complex and highly turbid region, Vengurla rocks, situated on the west coast of India. The objective of the study was to evaluate the best suitable technique for SDB in turbid water. The bathymetry product images have been derived using the two most commonly utilized log ratio, and linear ratio transformation; three semi-automated methods, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and ratio transform; and Machine Learning (ML) regression algorithms. Among the applied transform and algorithms, the ML algorithm using 561 nm band data performed the best, resulting in R2 of 0.77, RMSE of 3.4 m, and MAE of 2.8 m. This work established that open source images of sensor OLI/Landsat-8 satellite provide the best results of SDB estimation in complex turbid water by applying ML algorithms. However, extreme turbid and complex regions resulted in more erroneous SDB estimation specifying the need for refining algorithms using bio-optical parameters. © 2022 National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR).

In this study, the potential for deploying machine learning algorithms, including principal component regression (PCR), support vector regression (SVR) and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network, are tested to build predictive models. These tools were used to estimate chemical dosage at a daily time-scale. Influent water quality such as pH, color, turbidity, and alkalinity, as well as chemical dosage including sulfuric acid, ferric sulfate and liquid oxygen were used to build and test these models. An 80/20 percent data split was used for training and testing model performance using correlation coefficients, relative mean square error, relative root mean square error and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency. Results indicate, compared with PCR, both SVR and LSTM were able to capture the nonlinear relationship between chemical dose and source water quality changes and displayed higher predictive skills. These types of models have application in real-time operational support without requiring computationally expensive physics-based models. © 2022 The Authors","Chemical dosage prediction; Domestic water supply; Drinking water treatment plants; Long short-term memory neural network; Machine learning algorithms; Support vector machine","Alkalinity; Liquefied gases; Long short-term memory; Mean square error; Potable water; Sulfur compounds; Support vector machines; Water quality; Water supply; Water treatment; Water treatment plants; Chemical dosage; Chemical dosage prediction; Domestic water supply; Drinking water treatment plants; Long short-term memory neural network; Machine learning algorithms; Neural-networks; Principal Components; Support vector regressions; Support vectors machine; Iron compounds; drinking water; ferric sulfate; oxygen; polymer; sulfuric acid; drinking water; prediction; water quality; water treatment plant; alkalinity; Article; color; correlation coefficient; long short term memory network; machine learning; nonlinear system; pH; predictive model; principal component regression; support vector machine; turbidity; water quality; water supply; water treatment",,"ferric sulfate, 10028-22-5; oxygen, 7782-44-7; sulfuric acid, 7664-93-9",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abdi, H., Williams, L.

In addition to other methods for the determination of the size distribution of droplets, the usage of machine learning during microscopic analyses can enhance the reliability of the measurements and decrease the measurement cost at the same time. Considering its role in emulsion characteristics, in this study, the droplet size distributions of emulsions prepared with different oil/water phase ratios and homogenization times were measured with both a microscopy-assisted digital image analysis technique and a well-known laser diffraction method. The relationships between the droplet size and the physical properties of emulsions (turbidity and viscosity) were also investigated. The results showed that microscopic measurements yielded slightly higher values for the D(90), D[3,2], and D[4,3] of emulsions compared to the laser diffraction method for all oil/water phase ratios. When using this method, the droplet size had a meaningful correlation with the turbidity and viscosity values of emulsions at different oil/water phase ratios. From this point of view, the usage of the optical microscopy method with machine learning can be useful for the determination of the size distribution in emulsions. © 2022 by the authors.

However, many of these models are black boxes that are difficult for humans to understand, which may cause severe consequences such as unexplained decisions and failure in accountability. To develop interpretable predictive models for beach water quality, we evaluate five tree-based models, namely classification tree, random forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM, and employ a state-of-the-art explanation method SHAP to explain the models. When tested on the Escherichia coli (E. coli) concentration data collected from three beach sites along Lake Erie shores, LightGBM, followed by XGBoost, achieves the highest averaged precision and recall scores. For all three sites, both models suggest lake turbidity as the most important predictor, and elucidate the crucial role of accurate local data of wave height and rainfall in the model development. Local SHAP values further reveal the robustness of the importance of lake turbidity as its SHAP value increases nearly monotonically with its value and is minimally affected by other environmental factors. Moreover, we found an intriguing interaction between lake turbidity and day-of-year. This work suggests that the combination of LightGBM and SHAP has a promising potential to develop interpretable models for predicting microbial water quality in freshwater lakes. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Beach water quality; Fecal indicator bacteria; Lake turbidity; LightGBM; Machine learning; SHAP","Beaches; Decision trees; Escherichia coli; Forecasting; Health risks; Lakes; Machine learning; Water quality; Beach water qualities; Ensemble models; Faecal indicator bacteria; Lake turbidity; Lightgbm; Machine learning models; Model-based OPC; SHAP; Tree-based; Tree-based ensembles; Turbidity; fresh water; rain; concentration (composition); lacustrine environment; physicochemical property; rainfall; water quality; Article; catboost; classification; controlled study; decision tree; dimensionality reduction; environmental factor; Escherichia coli; histogram; lake; lightgbm; machine learning; measurement accuracy; nonhuman; periodicity; prediction; random forest; seashore; solar radiation; turbidity; water quality; xgboost; environmental monitoring; feces; human; microbiology; swimming; Great Lakes [North America]; Lake Erie; Bathing Beaches; Environmental Monitoring; Escherichia coli; Feces; Humans; Lakes; Water Microbiology; Water Quality",,,,,"Great Lakes Research Consortium, GLRC","We thank Rebecca R.

The importance of water quality is increasing with the ascending water pollution owing to industrialization and depletion of fresh water sources. The countries having low control on reducing water pollution are likely to retain poor public health. Additionally, the methods being used in most developing countries are not effective and are based more on human intervention than on technological and automated solutions. Typically, most of the water samples and related data are monitored and tested in laboratories, which eventually consumes time and effort at the expense of producing fewer reliable results. In view of the above, there is an imperative need to devise a proper and systematic system to regularly monitor and manage the quality of water resources to arrest the related issues. Towards such ends, Internet of Things (IoT) is a great alternative to such traditional approaches which are complex and ineffective and it allows taking remote measurements in real-time with minimal human involvement. The proposed system consists of various water quality measuring nodes encompassing various sensors including dissolved oxygen, turbidity, pH level, water temperature, and total dissolved solids. These sensors nodes deployed at various sites of the study area transmit data to the server for processing and analysis using GSM modules. The data collected over months is used for water quality classification using water quality indices and for bacterial prediction by employing machine learning algorithms. For data visualization, a Web portal is developed which consists of a dashboard of Web services to display the heat maps and other related info-graphics. The real-time water quality data is collected using IoT nodes and the historic data is acquired from the Rawal Lake Filtration Plant. Several machine learning algorithms including neural networks (NN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), ridge regression (RR), support vector machines (SVM), decision tree regression (DTR), Bayesian regression (BR), and an ensemble of all models are trained for fecal coliform bacterial prediction, where SVM and Bayesian regression models have shown the optimal performance with mean squared error (MSE) of 0.35575 and 0.39566 respectively. The proposed system provides an alternative and more convenient solution for bacterial prediction, which otherwise is done manually in labs and is an expensive and time-consuming approach. In addition to this, it offers several other advantages including remote monitoring, ease of scalability, real-time status of water quality, and a portable hardware. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Data analytic;

To expedite microbial water quality determinations, many researchers estimate concentrations of the microbial contamination indicator Escherichia coli (E. coli) from the concentrations of physiochemical water quality parameters. However, these relationships are often non-linear and exhibit changes above or below certain threshold values. Machine learning (ML) algorithms have been shown to make accurate predictions in datasets with complex relationships. The purpose of this work was to evaluate several ML models for the prediction of E. coli in agricultural pond waters. Two ponds in Maryland were monitored from 2016 to 2018 during the irrigation season. E. coli concentrations along with 12 other water quality parameters were measured in water samples. The resulting datasets were used to predict E. coli using stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) machines, random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVM), and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithms. The RF model provided the lowest RMSE value for predicted E. coli concentrations in both ponds in individual years and over consecutive years in almost all cases. For individual years, the RMSE of the predicted E. coli concentrations (log10 CFU 100 ml−1) ranged from 0.244 to 0.346 and 0.304 to 0.418 for Pond 1 and 2, respectively. For the 3-year datasets, these values were 0.334 and 0.381 for Pond 1 and 2, respectively. In most cases there was no significant difference (P &gt; 0.05) between the RMSE of RF and other ML models when these RMSE were treated as statistics derived from 10-fold cross-validation performed with five repeats. Important E. coli predictors were turbidity, dissolved organic matter content, specific conductance, chlorophyll concentration, and temperature. Model predictive performance did not significantly differ when 5 predictors were used vs. 8 or 12, indicating that more tedious and costly measurements provide no substantial improvement in the predictive accuracy of the evaluated algorithms.

Using Machine Leaning the data was trained on the two different aspects one with preferred to use and not suitable for usage. Prediction of water quality will help to reduce water pollution and guard our human, animal and agricultural field health. An intelligent process of monitoring the quality of water can automatically detects the condition of water through sensors like pH, turbidity, and temperature in sewage water and through Arduino, sensed data is sent to a cloud server which is used to provide an information to a water analyst.

High level of Chl-a can cause the degradation of the fresh water, accelerate the production of taste and odor, and have the greatest potential for adverse ecological and human health effects. While a number of existing standard methods can be used to quantify and measure Chl-a concentration in rivers, lakes, and streams ecosystems, which are laborious and time consuming, the use of alternative methods based on modeling approaches can help in improving the control of eutrophication. In the present study, we introduce a new nontuned-machine learning model called the optimally pruned extreme learning machine (OPELM) for predicting the Chl-a concentration at the Charles and Mystic River, USA. For developing the models, we used several water quality variables namely, water temperature, pH, specific conductance, turbidity, and dissolved oxygen. The accuracy of the proposed OPELM models were evaluated using well-known statistical metrics: correlation coefficient (R), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), Legates-McCabe's Index (LM), Willmott Index of agreement (WI), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), relative root mean square error (RRMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Our results show that the calculated Chl-a concentration was strongly correlated with those measured values with a high degree of homogeneity, and the results were significantly better than those obtained using the standalone multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN). It is concluded that the OPELM is an effective tool to accurately predict the Chl-a concentration. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we propose the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques on sound navigation and ranging (Sonar) readings of tanks to predict fish biomass under both clear and murky water conditions. While previous works have proposed similar approaches, they generally face two operational challenges. First, typical setups consider RGB or infrared cameras, which are strongly influenced by water conditions and limit their application, for RGB cameras the light penetration is severely affected by water turbidity, while infrared is strongly absorbed by water. Second, modern fish farming installations such as recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) operate high-density or super high-density fish tanks, which introduce additional challenges such as noise in sensor readings and occlusions. Our method addresses these issues by (i) leveraging Sonar technology which is less susceptible to variations in water conditions and performs well under both clear and murky water(turbid water); and (ii) designing a custom loss function to reduce the effect of noise which can result in overestimation, and occlusions which can lead to the underestimation in the prediction of fish biomass. We achieve an overall root mean squared error (RMSE) of around 5 for both clear and murky water using both machine learning and deep learning approaches, which is a reasonable value for our dataset. The custom loss function with additional penalties and constraints improves the RMSE and R2 performance over our preliminary results. The assessment was performed on data collected in an actual operational environment, comprising minimally configured RAS tanks at Blue Aqua International, which is an aquaculture technology provider and a fish farm that intends to develop and commercialize a product for automated biomass estimation. © 2022 IEEE.","aquaculture; biomass estimation; deep learning; ensemble learning; predictive model; regression; SONAR; transfer learning","Aquaculture; Biomass; Cameras; Deep learning; Fish; Image enhancement; Learning systems; Tanks (containers); Biomass estimation; Deep learning; Ensemble learning; Fish farms; Machine-learning; Predictive models; Regression; RGB cameras; Transfer learning; Water conditions; Mean square error",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2020) The state of world fisheries and aquaculture 2020. sustainability in action, , FAO. rome; Saberioon, M., Csar, P., Automated within tank fish mass estimation using infrared reflection system (2018) Computers and electronics in agriculture, 150, pp. 484-492; Mclean, E., Craig, J., Dickerman, A., Craig, S., (2014) Aquanomics: The application of genomic technologies to aquaculture, 12, pp. 161-169; Lopes, F., Silva, H., Almeida, J., Pinho, C., Silva, E., Fish farming autonomous calibration system (2017) OCEANS 2017-Aberdeen.

In the absence of direct in situ measurement, alternative methods based on the different modeling approaches can be useful tools for predicting river TU. In this research, a novel modeling strategy for predicting river water turbidity using only measured river discharge (Q) has been proposed. Time series of river TU and Q measured at four United States Geological Survey (USGS) gauging stations located in a different region of the United States of America are employed for calibrating and testing several machine learning models. Specifically, four models were proposed and compared: the hybrid bat algorithm optimized extreme learning machine (Bat-ELM), the standalone feedforward artificial neural network (FFNN), the off-line dynamic evolving neural-fuzzy inference system called DENFIS_F, and the on-line dynamic evolving neural fuzzy inference system called DENFIS_O. The models were developed using the Q as input variables combined with the three components of the Gregorian calendar, i.e., the year, month, and day numbers. The models were evaluated using well-known performance evaluation metrics, i.e., coefficient of correlation (R), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), MAE, and RMSE. In general, the Bat-ELM performed best, more accurate than all other models, exhibiting the high R and NSE indexes with values ranging from 0.898 to 0.971 and from 0.806 to 0.936, respectively. It was also found that the inclusion of the periodicity contributed significantly to the improvement of the models performances. Furthermore, obtained results in the present study were encouraging and can be used a basis for future investigation related to river water turbidity modeling and forecasting. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Large data set at daily and hourly time scale of the nitrate (NO3) and water temperature (Tw), dissolved oxygen (DO), specific conductance (SC), water turbidity (TU), pH, and discharge (Q) were acquired from Willamette River, USA, and used for developing the models. For each time scale, i.e., daily and hourly, two scenarios were tested: (1) using only water quality variables as inputs and (2) using water quality variables combined with the periodicity. At daily time scale, a strong correlation was observed between measured and calculated NO3, and the best accuracies was obtained using the LSTM model, while the lowest accuracies were obtained using the ELM model. However, inclusion of the periodicity significantly improves the models performances. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Everyone has the right to have access to pollution-free water. The achievement of safe drinking water leads to tangible benefits to health. According to the World Health organization (WHO), the number of global deaths due to water diseases is about two and a half million deaths per year. Therefore, it is important to study new applications for analyzing and classifying safe water quality. In this research, the classification algorithms of K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Logistic Regression (LR), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used to classify the potability of the drinking water. RF and DT achieved the highest performance with an accuracy of 83.78% and 74.98% respectively. The lowest classifier accuracy is LR with 48.74%. In addition, the most important features of the RF model are pH, followed by Hardness, followed by Sulfate. On other hand, the least important feature is Turbidity. © 2022 IEEE.","ANN; Drinking; DT; KNN; Learning; LR; Machine; Potability; Quality; RF; Safe; SVM; Water","Decision trees; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Logistic regression; Nearest neighbor search; Potable water; Sulfur compounds; Support vector machines; Water pollution; Water quality; Drinking; K near neighbor; Learning; Logistics regressions; Machine; Nearest-neighbour; Potability; Quality; Random forests; Safe; Support vectors machine; Neural networks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Taruna, J., Alankrita, C., Assessment of water quality and its effects on the health of residents of Jhunjhunu district, Rajasthan: A cross-sectional study (2013) Journal of Public Health and Epidemiology, 5 (4), pp. 186-191; Seema, T., Water Quality Parameters (2015) International Journal of Engineering Science Invention Research & Development, 1 (9), pp. 319-324; (2011) Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality, , World Health Organization, Switzerland; Sidrah, H., Man, S., Hung, C., Majid, N., Janet, N., Sawaid, A., Danling, T., Comparison of machine learning algorithms for retrieval of water quality indicators in case-II waters: A case study of Hong Kong (2018) Remote Sens, 10, pp. 1-26; Hamzeh, A., Ali, N., Water quality prediction using machine learning methods (2018) Water Quality Research Journal, 53 (1), pp. 3-13; Aldhyani, T., Water Quality Prediction Using Artificial Intelligence Algorithms (2020) Applied Bionics and Biomechanics, 4 (2), pp. 1-12; Radhakrishnan, N., Anju, P., Comparison of Water Quality Classification Models using Machine Learning (2020) 5th International Conference on Communication and Electronics Systems (ICCES, 8; Muhammad, H., Ramadhan, F., Fatimah, Z., Linda, K., Afrida, H., Classification of Water Potability Using Machine Learning Algorithms (2021) International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Big Data Analytics, 2; Muhammad, S., Makhtar, M., Rozaimee, A., Abdul Aziz, A., Classification Model for Water Quality using Machine Learning Techniques (2015) International Journal of Software Engineering and Its Applications, 9 (6), pp. 45-52; Aditya, K., Water-potability (2020) Kaggle, , https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability; Denis, C., Sylvain, C., Outliers detection and treatment: A review (2010) International Journal of Psychological Research, 3 (1), pp. 59-68; Zhongheng, Z., Introduction to machine learning: K-nearest neighbors (2016) Annals of Translational Medicine, 11, pp. 1-7; Aashoo, B., Kavita, D., Manish, S., Implementation of Decision Tree (2012) International Journal of Engineering and Advanced Technology (IJEAT, 2 (2), pp. 30-34; Pineda, J., Juan, D., A review of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms used for modeling travel mode choice (2019) Universidad Nacional de Colombia, , Colombia; Maher, M., Logistic regression in data analysis: An overview (2009) International Journal of Data Analysis Techniques and Strategies, 3 (3)","Yusuf, H.; University of Bahrain, Bahrain; email: 20166225@stu.uob.edu.bh",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2022 International Conference on Data Analytics for Business and Industry, ICDABI 2022","25 October 2022 through 26 October 2022",,186761,,9781665490580,,,"English","Int.

Eleven sites from the Danube Delta were sampled in spring and autumn for three years (20182020) and 21 water physico-chemical parameters were measured in laboratory. Several families of machine learning algorithms, translated into hundreds of models with different parameterizations for each machine learning algorithm, based on remote sensing data input from Sentinel 2 spectral bands, were employed to find the best models that predicted the values measured in laboratory. This was a novel approach, reflected in the types of selected models that minimised the values of performance metrics for the tested parameters. For alkalinity, calcium, chloride, carbon dioxide, hardness, potassium, sodium, ammonium, dissolved oxygen, sulphates, and suspended matter the results were promising, with an overall percentage bias of the estimates of +/-10% from the observed values. For copper, magnesium, nitrites, nitrates, turbidity and zinc the estimates were fairly accurate, with percentage biases in the interval +/-10%-20%, whereas for detergents, led, and phosphates the percentage bias was higher than 20%. Overall, the results of the current study showed fairly good estimates between remote sensing based estimates and laboratory measured values for most water physico-chemical parameters. © 2022, Editura Silvica.

Conventional water quality index (WQI) assessment methods are limited to features such as water acidic or basicity (pH), dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N), and suspended solids (SS). These features are often insufficient to represent the water quality of a heavy metal-polluted river. Therefore, this paper aims to explore and analyze novel input features in order to formulate an improved WQI. In this work, prospective insights on the feasibility of alternative water quality input variables as new discriminant features are discussed. The new discriminant features are a step toward formulating adaptive water quality parameters according to the land use activities surrounding the river. The results and analysis obtained from this study have proven the possibility of predicting WQI using new input features. This work analyzes 17 new input features, namely conductivity (COND), salinity (SAL), turbidity (TUR), dissolved solids (DS), nitrate (NO3), chloride (Cl), phosphate (PO4), arsenic (As), chromium (Cr), zinc (Zn), calcium (Ca), iron (Fe), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), E. coli, and total coliform, in predicting WQI using machine learning techniques. Five regression algorithms'random forest (RF), AdaBoost, support vector regression (SVR), decision tree regression (DTR), and multilayer perception (MLP)'are applied for preliminary model selection. The results show that the RF algorithm exhibits better prediction performance, with R2 of 0.974. Then, this work proposes a modified RF by incorporating the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) into the conventional RF method. The proposed modified RF method is shown to achieve 77.68%, 74%, 69%, and 71% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, respectively. In addition, the sensitivity analysis is included to highlight the importance of the turbidity variable in WQI prediction. The results of sensitivity analysis highlight the importance of certain water quality variables that are not present in the conventional WQI formulation. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

This study aimed to develop fish mortality risk prediction for the next day using machine-learning from a water quality data sensor network and daily fish mortality record input by the fish farmers. This study uses seawater temperature, current, salinity, conductivity, chlorophyll, turbidity and DO (dissolved oxygen) as water quality attributes. This study used Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to detect periodic fluctuation of seawater temperature and found that 12-day, 7-day and 3-day are important periodic indicators. Yet, when and how water quality affects fish mortality is unknown, hence, this study used the moving average (MA) based on FFT results to capture the trend in the data. The independent variables for the prediction were MA of sea water temperature, current, salinity, chlorophyll, turbidity and DO. Conductivity was omitted due to the high correlation with salinity. The dependent variable was daily five levels of fish mortality based on the number of fish mortality characteristics to make it easier for providing the prediction result to the fish farmer. This study used python 3 and Random Forest (RF) algorithm in the Scikit-learn library to predict the daily fish mortality. This study found that the accuracy of the proposed prediction worked best using the 3-day moving average data set. In particular, the average accuracy of 10-time running the prediction was 74.92%. RF feature importance indicated that sea water temperature, salinity and turbidity are important variables to predict fish mortality in the target area. © 2022 IEEE.","DSS; fish mortality; machine learning; Mariculture; random forest; water quality sensor network","Biochemical oxygen demand; Chlorophyll; Dissolved oxygen; Fish; Forecasting; Forestry; Machine learning; Marine biology; Seawater; Temperature; Turbidity; Water quality; DSS; Fish mortality; Machine-learning; Mariculture; Moving averages; Random forests; Seawater temperature; Sensors network; Water quality sensor network; Water quality sensors; Sensor networks",,,,,"JPMJSA1610; Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST","ACKNOWLEDGMENT The work in this paper was conducted under the JST/JICASATREPS project titled “Optimizing Mariculture based on Big Data with Decision Support System” (grant number: JPMJSA1610).",,,,,,,,,,"http://puslitbangkan.balitbangkp.kkp.go.id/profil/bbppbl-gondol/, Mariculture Research Center Gondol, Bali; Tadjuddah, M., Wiryawan, B., Purbayanto, A., Wiyono, E.S., Mapping analysis of life groupers trade in Wakatobi Marine National Park, Southeast Sulawesi Province, Indonesia (2012) Buletin PSP, 20 (2), pp. 119-130; Arfah, K.A., Analysis market potential of grouper in Bonetambu Island, Ujung Tanah Subdistrict, Barrang Caddi Village, Makassar City (2017) Gema Kampus IISIP YAPIS Biak, 12 (2), pp. 50-65; Inoue, K., Septory, R., Albasri, H., Wada, M., Mass mortality risk prediction and fish loss simulation in mariculture (2020) Global Oceans 2020: Singapore-U.S. Gulf Coast, pp. 1-6; Wada, M., Hatanaka, K., Saville, R., Radiarta, I.N., Sugama, K., Marine observation framework using ICT for mariculture in Indonesia (2013) 2013 OCEANS-San Diego, pp. 1-6; Wada, M., Hatanaka, K., Natsir, M., Development of Automated SeaCondition Monitoring System for Aquaculture in Indonesia (2019) Sens.Mater, 31 (3), pp. 773-784. , March",,,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2022 OCEANS Hampton Roads, OCEANS 2022","17 October 2022 through 20 October 2022",,185307,01977385,9781665468091,OCNSD,,"English","Oceans Conf Rec IEEE",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85145769093

However, this method is expensive, time-consuming, and requires laboratory equipment. In this situation, machine learning, especially hybrid machine learning, is suitable to estimate the CD without requiring a jar test. To this end, a hybrid model based on a combination of the M5 and the gorilla troops optimizer (GTO) algorithm was introduced as the M5-GTO model. Nine different parameters, including raw water production (RWP), turbidity of water, Conductivity, TDS, Salinity, pH, water temperature (WT), SM, and O2, were also utilized as inputs in the CD modeling. The results of comparing the proposed model with the multiple linear regression, multiple nonlinear regression, artificial neural network, multivariate adaptive regression splines, M5 model tree, k-nearest neighbor, least-squares support vector machine, general regression neural network, and random forest (RF) showed that this model is more accurate in CD modeling. Besides, the M5-GTO well estimated the distribution of observational data. For example, the values of the mean absolute error, root mean square error (RMSE), relative RMSE, normalized RMSE, and correlation coefficient criteria for the M5-GTO were equal to 0.562, 1.172, 0.257, 0.170, and 0.967, which were up to 73%, 54.9%, 54.8%, 55%, and 4% are more accurate than LSSVM (worst algorithm), respectively. In addition, the M5 and RF algorithms were also in the second and third ranks. The partial dependence plots results showed that the RWP and WT had the most significant effects on CD changes. Increasing the RWP reduced the amount of CD, while increasing the WT increased the CD. The algorithm introduced in the present study has a high potential for modeling various parameters in water treatment plants. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","M5-GTO algorithm;

Recently, computer vision has been applied in many fields to extract useful information from images. To increase the production with less cost, computer vision is also used to monitor the products of aquaculture. Usually, to ensure the accuracy of computer vision, a relatively high-quality picture is required. Since shrimp is benthic animal and the water of shrimp pond is usually turbidity, the quality of underwater photos is usually poor. Compared to optical photos, the imaging mechanism of ultrasound is less affected by the above effects. Therefore, in this study, an innovative white shrimp monitoring system combining ultrasound imaging technology and YOLOv4 is proposed. The database of shrimps' ultrasonic images is built by imaging the different parts of the shrimps from various viewing angles with a linear ultrasonic probe. Through moving the ultrasound probe by a 2-axis motor, the images could be captured from two orthogonal viewing angles within a 12.69cm x 12.69cm region of interest. After 260 images are captured, the locations of shrimps in each image would be recognized and the centers of bounding boxes will be marked. After that, a custom grouping method based on spectral clustering algorithm would be applied to distinguish the number of shrimps. Finally, the length and location of shrimps would be calculated from the best corresponding fitting line. After examining the proposed system with 30 sets of different number, size, and location of shrimps, the accuracy of identifying the number of shrimps is 97.3% along with 8.99% averaged length error and 0.97 cm averaged position error. These results demonstrate the feasibility of monitoring shrimp farms using proposed system. © 2022 IEEE.","Computer Vision; Shrimp Detection; Ultrasound","Aquaculture; Clustering algorithms; Environmental impact; Image segmentation; Location; Machine learning; Nanocomposites; Probes; Ultrasonic imaging; Critical factors; High quality; Imaging mechanism; Machine learning approaches; Monitoring system; On-machines; Optical-; Shrimp detection; Shrimp ponds; Viewing angle; Computer vision",,,,,"National Science Council, NSC: 110-2313-B-006 -005 -MY3","The authors would like to thank the funding under National Science Council from Taiwan.

The main goal of that miner is to find water quality based on 12 types of concentrations that cause water pollution, which are: potential hydrogen (PH), total dissolved solids (TDS), turbidity unit (NTU), total hardness (TH), total alkalinity, calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), sodium (Na), chloride (Cl), nitrate (NO3), and sulfate (SO4). IM12CP-WQI is multi-phased; the first phase relates to collection of data through two seasons (i.e., summer and winter). The second phase, called preprocessing of data, includes (a) combination samples related to each season with its focus independently and (b) normalization the dataset through MinMaxScaler to make dataset in range (0, 1). The third phase is related to building the predictor based on developing MARS through replaced the kernel function of it (i.e., base function) by one of optimization algorithm called (i.e., Bat) to find the best of weight for each concentration, number of base model “M” of that MARS. After that, dividing the dataset based on five cross-validation principles into training and testing dataset, we will use the training dataset to build the predictor. While testing dataset evolution in the final phase, the results will offer an evaluation of each season by taking the readings of all concentrations for reigns and then computing three measures called R2, NSE, and D. We can summarize the main stages of this research as explained below: collection the concentrations of the PH, TDS, NTU, TH, TA, Ca, Mg, K, Na, Cl, NO3, and SO4 by dealing with a dataset of each season. Splitting the dataset of each season into parts, training, and testing the dataset based on five cross-validation concepts, we build a new predictor called Intelligent Miner based on twelve concentrations to predict water quality index (IM12CP-WQI) by the combination of the most advantageous features of both MARS and BA. Evaluation of the results of IM12CP-WQI is based on three measures. © Ron Waddams/Bridgeman Images.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Masrur Ahmed, A.A., Prediction of dissolved oxygen in Surma River by biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand using the artificial neural networks (ANNs) (2017) J.

It is widely used to predict the upcoming weather monitoring report. Weather is a climate in terms of temperature, air swing, rainfall, and cloud covering. Simultaneously, water quality was monitored by the turbidity level, and acid and base nature of water. This combination of weather forecasting and water quality management system is most useful for the applications such as Agrology, logistics transportation, and construction. Both the weather forecast and water quality management system were designed using machine learning algorithms. These hasty machine learning techniques are biased toward the modern Internet of Things, which is used to segregate and separate both the real-time and stored datasets. This proposed methodology is more beneficial for the field of agrology. This weather forecast helps to identify the soil's nature and environmental conditions. Water quality management helps to improve the yield and high protection for the crops. This proposed system is most eminent at the time of natural disasters.

Groundwater samples from 77 locations were collected and tested for the concentration of various physicochemical parameters. The collected data were assimilated in the form of a groundwater quality index to estimate groundwater quality (drinking and irrigation) using an information entropy-based weight determination approach (EWQI). The water quality maps obtained from the study area suggest a definite trend in groundwater contamination of the study area. Furthermore, the influence of different physicochemical parameters on groundwater quality was determined using machine learning techniques. Learning and prediction accuracies of four different techniques, namely artificial neural network (ANN), deep learning (DL), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting machine (GBM), were investigated. The performance of the ANN model (MEA = 11.23, RSME = 21.22, MAPE = 7.48, and R2 = 0.91) was found to be highly effective for the present dataset. The ANN model was then used to understand the relative influence of physicochemical parameters on groundwater quality. It was observed that the deterioration in groundwater quality in the study area was primarily due to the excess concentration of turbidity and iron values. The relatively higher concentration of sulfate and nitrate had caused a significant impact on the groundwater quality. The study has wider implications for modeling in similar drought-prone agricultural areas elsewhere for assessing the groundwater quality. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Drinking groundwater quality; Entropy-based groundwater quality; Groundwater quality index; Irrigation groundwater quality; Machine learning; Neural network",,,,,,"SR/FTP/ETA-486/2012; Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी; Science and Engineering Research Board, SERB","This work was supported by DST SERB, Government of India, SR/FTP/ETA-486/2012 dated 16.12.2016.

Those changes entail adjustments in drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) operations. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used for modelling water quality for different purposes and has yielded reliable results. However, there has not yet been wide investigation of raw water quality modelling for treatment purposes using AI. For the first time, in this critical review, we analyzed AI models founded on machine learning techniques that are used for surface water quality modelling and which could be applied in the domain of source water treatment. In a novel approach, we convened an expert panel that helped us define the appropriate criteria for use in the selection of the papers for review. We analysed the selected papers according to several criteria, including the feasibility of input data generation, the modelled data applicability and the benefits and limitations. We evaluated whether the selected models could be applied to forecast raw water quality as decision support systems (DSS) in drinking water treatment. The highest rated were turbidity hourly models based on Support Vector Machines (SVM), as well as daily turbidity and pH models based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). We found there is a shortage of models used to specifically estimate raw water quality, which could assist in DSS at DWTPs. There should be an increased effort to model raw water quality, especially with AI models using hourly and sub-hourly time step. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","drinking water; early warning systems; machine learning; modelling; Source water quality","Decision support systems; Learning systems; Neural networks; Support vector machines; Surface waters; Turbidity; Water quality; Water treatment; Critical review; Drinking water treatment; Early Warning System; Intelligence models; Machine-learning; Model-based OPC; Modeling; Raw water quality; Source water qualities; Water quality modelling; Potable water; drinking water; early warning system; machine learning; modeling; water quality; water treatment; water treatment plant",,,,,"Université Laval, UL; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC: IRC 476385-18","This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC [grant number IRC 476385-18].

In our study, data published by King County, Washington, USA, has been used to compare the performance of several algorithms which were used in predicting water quality index (WQI) and classifying water quality classification (WQC). Multilayer perceptron (MLP) performs most efficiently in both tasks with an RMSE of 0.76, R2 of 0.99, and classification accuracy of 97.1%. Feature analysis shows that phosphorus and ammonia nitrogen have considerable influence on predicting WQC and WQI, respectively, even though they were not directly used in the calculation of WQI. Sensitivity analysis done on the MLP model further shows that after removing the most important feature of turbidity as an input parameter, the model had an RMSE of 12.86 and an R2 of 0.84, respectively. It can be considered as one of the most significant parameters since it affects the WQI drastically. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Classification; Feature analysis; Multilayer perceptron; Regression; Supervised learning; Water quality index prediction","Ammonia; Classification (of information); Forecasting; Multilayer neural networks; Multilayers; Quality control; Sensitivity analysis; Supervised learning; Water pollution; Feature analysis; Index predictions; Machine learning approaches; Multilayers perceptrons; Quality classification; Regression; Supervised machine learning; Washington; Water quality index prediction; Water quality indexes; Water quality",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Rahmanian, N., Ali, S.H.B., Homayoonfard, M., Ali, N.J., Rehan, M., Sadef, Y., Nizami, A.S., Analysis of physicochemical parameters to evaluate the drinking water quality in the state of Perak, Malaysia.

There are four objectives of this work; (1) To develop an edge device for sensing the water quality parameters (2) to detect changes in the water quality with respect to base line parameter using a machine learning approach at the edge device itself (3) to generate the alarm signals when water quality parameters go beyond its threshold value and (3) to classify different types of contamination and analyze them for identifying possible contamination types. For the experimentation, three water quality indicative methods are used to calculate the water quality, namely (a) Weighted Arithmetic Index, (b) NSF Water Quality Index and (c) User feedback of the water quality. Water quality is determined using water quality indexes (WQI) on the basis of six physico-chemical sensor parameters like biological oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, pH, total hardness, total dissolved solids and turbidity. With the help of WQI of these methods, a light weight machine learning model which is suitable for the edge device, has been developed using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. We also clustered the alarming events to find out different types of alarming events. © 2022 IEEE.","Alarm Events; Edge Intelligence; Event Clustering; Machine Learning; Water Quality Index (WQI); Water Quality Sensors","Biochemical oxygen demand; Internet of things; Learning systems; Quality assurance; Support vector machines; Water quality; Alarm event; Edge intelligence; Event clustering; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Water quality index; Water quality indexes; Water quality monitoring; Water quality parameters; Water quality sensors; Dissolved oxygen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bhanderi, M.V., Shah, H.B., Machine Learning for Wireless Sensor Network: a Review, Challenges and Applications (2014) Research India Publications., 4 (12), pp. 475-486; Das, S., Udgata, S.K., Sensor Placement for Contamination Source Detection in Water Channel Networks (2021) Icc 2021-ieee International Conference on Communications, pp. 1-6; Yogendra, K., And E.t.

The safety of this water is a concern in many regions around the world, since polluted waters are increasing and causing the spread of disease among populations. Continuous management and evaluation of the water which is meant for drinking is very essential and must be taken seriously. Often, the quality of water is evaluated through regular laboratory testing and analysis which can be tiresome and time consuming. On the other hand, advanced technologies using big data with the help of machine learning can have better results in terms of potability evaluation. For this reason, several studies have been conducted on predicting the quality of water and the several factors and classification that affect the prediction model. In this study, a random forest model was developed using PySpark classification to predict the potability of river water by relying on ten different features: pH, hardness, presence of solids, presence of chloramines, presence of sulfate, conductivity, organic carbon, trihalomethanes, turbidity, and finally potability.

The importance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) continues to increase every day in our constantly advancing society. This investigative study aims to uncover the practicality of both AI and ML by utilizing it in a real world context, more specifically, to monitor aquatic behaviour. The aim of this investigation focuses on how ML can be used alongside appropriate hardware to effectively monitor the behaviour of aquatic organisms in response to changes in environmental factors. This paper describes the design, construction, testing and design decisions behind the development of a module which allows us to use ML in tandem with IoT sensors to fulfill the above aim. This investigation ultimately concludes that we were able to successfully conceptualize and create two designs and accompanying prototypes where their strengths lie in the presence of an ecosystem in which sensor data measured can be easily compared to the number of fishes detected by our object detection model to draw relationships between aquatic behaviour and different environmental factors. However it is limited due to the main hindrance of the prototypes’ incapability of maintaining clear visibility of fish in murky waters with high turbidity. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Arduino; Machine Learning; Raspberry Pi","Aquatic ecosystems; Computer vision; Internet of things; Machine learning; Object detection; Arduino; Artificial intelligence learning; Environmental factors; High school students; Independent research; Machine-learning; Raspberry pi; Real-world; Singapore; Vision machine; Fish",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2020) Living Planet Report 2020 – Bending the Curve of Biodiversity Loss, , Almond, R.E.A., Grooten, M., Petersen, T.

The proposed IoT solution discusses a device, capable of determining the water pollution level caused by an industry, near water bodies. The system would also be able to predict when the pollution level tends to cross the threshold value set by C.P.C.B. India in future. This information would eventually help in taking proactive remedial measures.The proposed device consists of four major sensors: pH sensor, turbidity sensor, flow sensor, and temperature sensor. These sensors would measure the water-parameters in real-time and send that data to Google Firebase (database) either through the WiFi module or, through the LoRa transmitter installed in the proposed device. Through LoRaWAN, all of these devices, which will be put at various industry-wastewater-outlets, will be wirelessly connected to a central hub. The goal is to use an optimized algorithm to make the system more energy efficient. The database would retain real-time data for two purposes: displaying it in the mobile app and using it in LSTM time-series forecasting (Machine Learning model) to predict when pollution levels could surpass the threshold. © 2022 IEEE.","Google Firebase; IoT; LoRaWAN; LSTM; Machine Learning; mobile application; pH; real-time; time-series forecasting; turbidity; water pollution","E-learning; Energy efficiency; Forecasting; Internet of things; Long short-term memory; pH; pH sensors; Time series; Google firebase; Google+; IoT; LoRaWAN; LSTM; Machine-learning; Mobile applications; Real- time; Time series forecasting; Water pollution levels; Water pollution",,,,,"SRM Institute of Science and Technology, SRMIST","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work is supported by Shri G.S Institute of Technology and Science.

As a consequence, marine growth cleaning on offshore structures has been performed for many years. While the industry has shifted from diver-assisted to cleaning driven by remotely operated vehicles, the process remains costly and ineffective. This paper explores the possibilities for introducing an increased level of automation for marine growth inspection and classification. Specific attention is given to sensor technologies and methods for constructing a 3D representation of the offshore structures in order to assess the thickness and composition of marine growth. While optical-based methods show positive potential further work is needed to investigate the robustness to flicking sunlight and turbidity issues experienced in areas close to the water surface. The review of classification methods reveals several promising approaches where deep learning is applied for the categorization of marine growth.

The continuous monitoring at high frequency (1 hour) of the water quality of the Sebou at the Mechra Bel Ksiri gauging station began in June 2020 using a multiparameter probe YSI (EXO2) and sensors. Real-time water quality data were collected in the Sebou River for Dissolved Oxygen, pH, temperature, electrical conductivity, turbidity, chlorides, and nitrates. Water level measurements were recorded at the same frequency by the radar. In this study, the high-frequency measurement highlights nycthemeral cycles at the day scale. A sine function model and three machine learning techniques: XGB Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Linear Regression, were used to develop data-driven models using temperature, nitrate levels, pH, and electrical conductivity to reproduce the daily fluctuations of dissolved oxygen. Each machine learning model was calibrated for each input scenario using 80% of the data obtained between June and November 2020 and validated using the remaining 20%. The evaluation simulations quality included the calculation of the error indices between simulations and observations (MAE and RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2). The prediction based on the three machine learning techniques gave good results for XGB Regressor, Linear Regression, and Random Forest Regressor with R2 values of 0.93, 0.89, and 0.88, respectively, while the sine function was slightly over-predicting the daily cycle of dissolved oxygen (mathrmR2=0.80) and indicated a relatively high saturation rate. The error indices were very low, with MAE and RMSE ranging in 0.05-0.06 and 0.06-0.08 respectively, which suggests satisfactory models performance. © 2022 IEEE.","Daily fluctuations; Dissolved oxygen; Machine-learning techniques; Sebou River; Sine equation; Water monitoring","Biochemical oxygen demand; Chlorine compounds; Decision trees; Dissolution; Electric conductivity; Functions; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Nitrates; Rivers; Water levels; Water quality; Daily fluctuations; Electrical conductivity; Error index; Machine learning techniques; Oxygen dynamics; Random forests; Sebou River; Sine equations; Sine functions; Water monitoring; Dissolved oxygen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Barthelemy, D., Goubier, M., Etude du cycle nycthemeral de la teneur en oxygene dissous en bassins de pisciculture par la methode des moyennes mobiles.

In the globe, the accessibility of water in safe and healthy ways is a major concern. The consumption of unsafe water may lead to health risks. Therefore, it is necessary to classify and monitor the quality of water, but the main issue is that sufficient parametric quality measures are not available with advanced technology. To overcome the above issue, this paper presents an IoT-based automated water quality monitoring system using cloud and machine learning algorithms. It contains various sensor devices such as pH sensors, temperature sensors, turbidity sensors, and conductivity sensors. The classification of water quality in an accurate way is achieved by using the fusion of K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The sensor values are generated and transferred in the cloud server via Node MCU with low power wide area networks (LPWAN). This proposed work can replace the classification and monitoring of the traditional method to qualify the water status. It helps to save human beings from various infections and diseases caused by the unsafe usage of water. Water quality classification is very important to create an eco-friendly environment. This proposed machine learning algorithm KNN + SVM is tested by 10-fold cross-validation and the highest accuracy is 0.94, when compared with the existing algorithm. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","KNN; LPWAN; Node MCU; sensors; SVM","Health risks; Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Low power electronics; Nearest neighbor search; pH sensors; Support vector machines; Water pollution; Water quality; Water treatment; K-near neighbor; Low Power; Low power wide area network; Machine learning algorithms; Nearest-neighbour; Node MCU; Sensor; Support vectors machine; Vital sources; Wide-area networks; Wide area networks",,,,,"King Saud University, KSU","This work was supported by the Researchers Supporting Project (No. RSP-2021/395), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",,,,,,,,,,"Koditala, N.K., Pandey, P.S., Water quality monitoring system using IoT and machine learning.

Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Aqua satellite provides a critical tool to map TSS and Chl-a on a daily basis. However, robust algorithms are required to retrieve TSS and Chl-a from MODIS/Aqua images in the turbid Pearl River Estuary (PRE). Here, a new artificial neural network algorithm was developed to estimate TSS and Chl-a in the PRE using a large amount of in situ measurements spanning more than a decade. Cross-validation showed that the ANN-based algorithm presented good performance with R2s of 0.73 and 0.66 for TSS and Chl-a, respectively. The ANN-based algorithm outperformed existing empirical and semi-analytical algorithms. By implementing the proposed algorithm to MODIS/Aqua images, TSS and Chl-a from August 2002 to July 2020 over the PRE were obtained. The results show that TSS decreased from northwest to southeast in all seasons while peaked in winter and summer. Chl-a peaked in summer and the high Chl-a patch transferred from the upper reach to the lower reach of the PRE with the increase of river discharge. TSS decreased at an annual rate of ∼0.13 mg L−1 while Chl-a increased at an annual rate of ∼0.05 mg m−3 in the last 18 years. Our findings suggest that machine learning provides a practical approach to estimate TSS and Chl-a in turbid estuaries via MODIS/Aqua images and the approach developed in this study can be applied to other turbid waters with similar optical properties. © 2021.

Traditional monitoring programs are limited in time and space, are expensive, and do not reflect the true extent of NTU. In contrast, remote sensing data are able to model the NTU, to monitor its spatial expansion, and are cost-effective. Models developed are usually a single-based function. This study presents a simple machine learning-based Regional hybrid model (R-HM) for NTU retrieval. The R-HM allows prior recognition of the NTU level concentration (high or low) before estimation. The calibration step highlighted that low and high NTUs are sensitive to different spectral regions, but mainly controlled by the red part. Validation was satisfactory with R{2} = 0.99 , although high NTUs tend to be underestimated (BIAS = -14%). Landsat (LS) NTU products derived from R-HM were found to be only sensitive to turbidity, even under conditions of high algal blooms. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Inland waters; Landsat (LS); machine learning; nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU); remote sensing; turbidity","Cost effectiveness; Learning systems; Remote sensing; Space optics; Turbidity; Water quality; Correlation; Inland waters; Landsat; Nephelometric turbidity unit; Nephelometric turbidity units; Remote-sensing; Systematic; Turbidity.; Calibration; calibration; estimation method; Landsat; machine learning; remote sensing; satellite imagery; stakeholder; turbidity; water quality",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Portielje, R., Molen Der Van, D.T., Relationships between eutrophication variables: From nutrient loading to transparency (1999) Shallow Lakes.

If not treated to an acceptable level, microbial pathogens present in the drinking water can result in severe consequences for public health. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the suitability of data-driven models of different complexity for predicting the concentrations of E. coli in the river Göta älv at the water intake of the drinking water treatment plant in Gothenburg, Sweden. The objectives were to (i) assess how the complexity of the model affects the model performance; and (ii) identify relevant factors and assess their effect as predictors of E. coli levels. To forecast E. coli levels one day ahead, the data on laboratory measurements of E. coli and total coliforms, Colifast measurements of E. coli, water temperature, turbidity, precipitation, and water flow were used. The baseline approaches included Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average), which are commonly used univariate methods, and a naive baseline that used the previous observed value as its next prediction. Also, models common in the machine learning domain were included: LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) Regression and Random Forest, and a tool for optimising machine learning pipelines – TPOT (Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool). Also, a multivariate autoregressive model VAR (Vector Autoregression) was included. The models that included multiple predictors performed better than univariate models. Random Forest and TPOT resulted in higher performance but showed a tendency of overfitting. Water temperature, microbial concentrations upstream and at the water intake, and precipitation upstream were shown to be important predictors. Data-driven modelling enables water producers to interpret the measurements in the context of what concentrations can be expected based on the recent historic data, and thus identify unexplained deviations warranting further investigation of their origin. © 2021","Artificial intelligence; Drinking water; E. coli; Machine learning; Microbial water quality","Decision support systems; Decision trees; Escherichia coli; Flow of water; Forecasting; Machine learning; Pipelines; Potable water; Regression analysis; Water treatment; Water treatment plants; Data driven modelling; E. coli; Machine-learning; Measurements of; Microbial water quality; Pipeline optimization; Random forests; Tree-based; Water intakes; Water temperatures; Water quality; biological marker; drinking water; river water; artificial intelligence; biomonitoring; coliform bacterium; drinking water; hydrometeorology; machine learning; modeling; prediction; water quality; Article; artificial intelligence; coliform bacterium; controlled study; decision tree; environmental factor; Escherichia coli; learning algorithm; machine learning; mathematical model; meteorology; nonhuman; quantitative structure activity relation; random forest; receiver operating characteristic; sea surface temperature; seasonal variation; sensitivity and specificity; support vector machine; time series analysis; turbidity; water flow; water quality; water supply; water temperature; environmental monitoring; Escherichia coli; microbiology; Goteborg; Sweden; Vastra Gotaland; Escherichia coli; Drinking Water; Environmental Monitoring; Escherichia coli; Water Microbiology; Water Quality",,"Drinking Water",,,"Vattenfall; Sveriges Meteorologiska och Hydrologiska Institut, SMHI; Svenska Forskningsrådet Formas","This research was conducted within the research project “ClimAQua – Modelling climate change impacts on microbial risks for a safe and sustainable drinking water system” grant number 2017-01413 funded by Formas – the Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning.

To carry out remote sensing monitoring of water transparency rapidly and intelligently, deep learning technology was used to construct a new retrieval model, namely, point-centered regression convolutional neural network (PSRCNN) suitable for Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 images. The impact of input feature variables on the accuracy of the inversion model was examined, and the performance of an optimized PSRCNN model was also assessed. This model was applied to remote sensing images of three shallow lakes in the eastern China plain acquired in summer. The PSRCNN model, constructed using five identical bands from Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 images and 20 band combinations as the input variables, the input window size of 5 × 5 pixels, proves a good predictive ability, with a verification accuracy of R2 = 0.85, the root mean squared error (RMSE) = 13.0 cm, and the relative predictive deviation (RPD) = 2.58. After the sensitive spectral analysis of water transparency, the band combinations that had correlation coefficients higher than 0.6 were selected as the new input feature variables to construct an optimized PSRCNN model (PSRCNNopt) for water transparency. The PSRCNNopt model has an excellent predictive ability, with a verification accuracy of R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 11.48 cm, and RPD =3.0. It outperforms the commonly retrieval models (band ratios, random forest, support vector machine, etc.), with higher accuracy and robustness. Spatial variations in water transparency of three lakes from the retrieval results by PSRCNNopt model are consistent with the field observations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Convolutional neural network;

In addition, until a change that the operator deems as ‘significant’ occurs, the plant tends to use the same dosage determined previously using the jar test for an elongated period of time. In this study, artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed to proactively decide what coagulant dosages to use based on changes in raw water parameters. Use of ANNs also prevents the regular use of costly chemicals used for jar tests and enables responding to sudden changes in water qualities. The general regression neural network (GRNN) and extreme learning machine neural networks require minimal computational effort for model development as they involve minimal model parameters and their training algorithms are not iterative. The current study determines the more convenient and efficient model of the two for aiding the coagulation process. The GRNN and ELM-RBF models predicted test data with R values of 0.9737 and 0.9783, respectively. It was noted that the GRNN was prone to overfitting and the ELM-RBF model demonstrated higher generalization ability than the GRNN. Therefore, it was concluded that the ELM-RBF model was the more suitable model for the prediction of the coagulant dosage. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Coagulation; Extreme learning machine; General regression neural network; Watertreatment","algorithm; artificial neural network; coagulation; computational fluid dynamics; machine learning; parameterization; regression analysis; turbidity; wastewater treatment plant; water treatment",,,,,,"The cooperation of Sabah Water Supply Department and LDWS for supplying Segama Water Treatment Plant data is greatly acknowledged.",,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, J.A., (1995) An Introduction to Neural Networks, , MIT Press; Balbay, A., Kaya, Y., Sahin, O., Drying of black cumin (Nigella sativa) in a microwave assisted drying system and modeling using extreme learning machine (2012) Energy, 44 (1), pp. 352-357; Bowden, G.J., Maier, H.R., Dandy, G.C., Optimal division of data for neural network models in water resources applications (2002) Water Resources Research, 38 (2), pp. 2-11; Deng, X., Lin, C., Application of ELM to predict the coagulant dosing in water treatment plant (2016) Water Science and Technology: Water Supply, 17 (4), pp. 1053-1061; Dharman, S., Chandramouli, V., Lingireddy, S., Predicting total organic carbon removal efficiency and coagulation dosage using artificial neural networks (2012) Environmental Engineering Science, 29 (8), pp. 743-750; Gagnon, C., Grandjean, B.P., Thibault, J., Modelling of coagulant dosage in a water treatment plant (1997) Artificial Intelligence in Engineering, 11 (4), pp. 401-404; Hagan, M.T., Demuth, H., Beale, M., Neural network design (2003) Mathworks.; Haghiri, S., Daghighi, A., Moharramzadeh, S., Optimum coagulant forecasting by modeling jar test experiments using ANNs (2018) Drinking Water Engineering and Science, 11 (1), pp. 1-8; Heddam, S., Bermad, A., Dechemi, N., Applications of radial-basis function and generalized regression neural networks for modeling of coagulant dosage in a drinking water-treatment plant: Comparative study (2011) Journal of Environmental Engineering, 137 (12), pp. 1209-1214; Heddam, S., Bermad, A., Dechemi, N., ANFIS-based modelling for coagulant dosage in drinking water treatment plant: A case study (2012) Environmental Monitoring and Assessment, 184 (4), pp. 1953-1971; Extreme learning machine: RBF network case (2004) ICARCV 2004 8Th Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision Conference, 2, pp. 1029-1036; Extreme learning machine: A new learning scheme of feedforward neural networks (2004) 2004 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IEEE Cat.

This study evaluated the impact of incorporating sediment information on improving the performance of machine learning models to quantify E. coli level in irrigation water. Field samples were collected from irrigation canals in the Southwest U.S., for which meteorological, chemical, and physical water quality variables as well as three additional flow and sediment properties: the concentration of E. coli in sediment, sediment median size, and bed shear stress. Water quality was classified based on E. coli concentration exceeding two standard levels: 1 E. coli and 126 E. coli colony forming units (CFU) per 100 ml of irrigation water. Two series of features, including (FIS) and excluding (FES) sediment features, were selected using multi-variant filter feature selection. The correlation analysis revealed the inclusion of sediment features improves the correlation with the target standards for E. coli compared to the models excluding these features. Support vector machine, logistic regression, and ridge classifier were tested in this study. The support vector machine model performed the best for both targeted standards. Besides, incorporating sediment features improved all models' performance. Therefore, the concentration of E. coli in sediment and bed shear stress are major factors influencing E. coli concentration in irrigation water. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bed shear stress; Classification technique; Kernel logistic regression; Principal component analysis; Sediment; Support vector machine","Health risks; Hydraulic structures; Irrigation; Principal component analysis; Quality control; Regression analysis; Sediments; Shear flow; Shear stress; Support vector machines; Water pollution; Water quality; Bed shear stresss; Classification technique; E-coli concentrations; E. coli; Irrigation water quality; Irrigation waters; Kernel logistic regression; Machine-learning; Principal-component analysis; Support vectors machine; Escherichia coli; ground water; oxygen; pyrazinamide; water; irrigation system; machine learning; numerical model; principal component analysis; shear stress; support vector machine; water quality; air temperature; aquaculture; aquatic environment; Article; bacterium detection; colony forming unit; conductance; controlled study; correlation analysis; cross validation; data visualization; dimensionality reduction; Escherichia coli; eutrophication; feature selection; flow rate; human; irrigation (agriculture); kernel method; learning algorithm; logistic regression analysis; machine learning; mathematical model; nonhuman; pH; principal component analysis; quantitative analysis; quantitative structure activity relation; relative humidity; salinity; sediment; shear stress; support vector machine; turbidity; water contamination; water quality; water temperature; irrigation (agriculture); machine learning; microbiology; United States; Escherichia coli; Agricultural Irrigation; Escherichia coli; Humans; Machine Learning; Water Microbiology; Water Quality",,"oxygen, 7782-44-7; pyrazinamide, 98-96-4; water, 7732-18-5","2100AN, Hach; Traceable","Hach","Center for Produce Safety, CPS: 2019CPS04","The authors are grateful to The Center for Produce Safety for funding this research (Grant # 2019CPS04 ).

Numerous monitoring tools have been developed that can alert stakeholders to the onset of cyanobacterial blooms to initiate mitigation efforts for waters used for recreation or drinking water supply. Early warning monitoring systems need to consider multiple aspects of a cyanobacterial bloom: whether a bloom is occurring in the source water, whether it might be transported to drinking water intakes, whether toxin or taste and odor compound producers are present and what proportion of the cells in a bloom they comprise, and whether cells are entering a utility at concentrations above threshold levels. No single monitoring tool can provide all this information, so multi-barrier approaches are needed. Reviews of monitoring tools and their variations are available, but they are generally limited to one type of tool. Instead, a review and comparison of all the available tools is needed to inform stakeholders of them and their relative advantages and limitations. Therefore, this review covers conventional tools including microscopic enumeration, pigment extraction, qPCR, probes, and remote sensing as well as emerging techniques including next-generation sequencing, photonic systems, biosensors, drones, and applications of machine learning and discusses them primarily from a practical and operational standpoint. Moreover, a three-tier framework is proposed for designing comprehensive early warning systems that groups monitoring tools by their analytical targets: biological activity or algal biomass, cyanobacteria or cyanobacteria-related genes, and cyanobacterial metabolites. First tier tools are generally simple and inexpensive to use, including turbidity, optical density, visual inspection, drones, chlorophyll a, and adenosine triphosphate. Changes in water quality conditions detected using a first tier tool triggers the use of a second tier tools for identification and quantification of cyanobacteria by microscopy, phycocyanin, biosensors, hyperspectral remote sensing, or next-generation sequencing. If potentially harmful concentrations of cyanobacteria are confirmed, third tier tools are deployed for quantifying concentrations of cyanotoxins and taste and odor compounds or the genes that encode for them using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, mass spectrometry, qPCR, or other analytical methods. This framework is designed to minimize the time and cost associated with cyanobacteria monitoring without compromising the ability of stakeholders to detect the onset of a bloom. © 2021 The Authors","Artificial intelligence; Automated cell imaging; Drones; Monitoring; Phycocyanin; Remote sensing","Artificial intelligence; Bioactivity; Biosensors; Drones; Electronic nose; Genes; Mass spectrometry; Metabolites; Monitoring; Polymerase chain reaction; Potable water; Water quality; Water supply; Automated cell; Automated cell imaging; Cell imaging; Cyanobacterial blooms; Cyanobacterium; Early warning; Monitoring tools; Phycocyanin; Remote-sensing; Taste and odour; Remote sensing; bioassay; detection method; drinking water; early warning system; indigenous knowledge; knowledge; machine learning; remote sensing; threshold; water quality; Cyanobacteria",,,,,"Water Research Foundation, WRF: 4912; Water Research Australia; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC: CRDPJ 482052-15; Fonds de recherche du Québec – Nature et technologies, FRQNT","This work was funded by the Water Research Foundation (Project #4912).

In order to solve the problem of insufficient application of remote sensing water quality monitoring in urban rivers. In this paper, based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) images and measured water quality data, the genetic algorithm_extreme gradient boosting (GA_XGBoost) algorithm is used to model water quality parameters in the study area, combined with its characteristics of supporting urban river polymorphism learning and semantic feature analysis. The results show that the coefficient of determination (R2) of GA_XGBoost algorithm for chlorophyll a (Chla), total phosphorous (TP), total nitrogen (TN), ammonia–nitrogen (NH3-N) and turbidity (TUB) is 0.855, 0.699, 0.787, 0.694, and 0.597, respectively, indicating a high precision and the predicted results are consistent with the measured data. Meanwhile, this paper compares the GA_XGBoost model with other algorithms: Deep Neural Network (DNN), Random Forest, genetic algorithm_RandomForest (GA_RandomForest), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) and genetic algorithm_adaptive boosting (GA_AdaBoost), and the performance of the GA_XGBoost model is better. At the same time, data from different periods have been added to verify the model's applicability. Moreover, based on the inversion results, analyze from the point of view of point source pollution, non-point source pollution, etc., to further investigate the influencing factors that cause urban river pollution. The current method has important practical significance for promoting the intelligent and automatic level of water environment monitoring technology in ecological environmental protection and urban water resources protection. © 2021 The Authors","Machine learning; UAV remote sensing; Urban river; Water quality inversion","Adaptive boosting; Ammonia; Antennas; Decision trees; Deep neural networks; Environmental technology; Genetic algorithms; Nitrogen; Remote sensing; River pollution; Rivers; Semantics; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Urban growth; Boosting algorithm; Gradient boosting; Human environment; Multi-spectral data; Remote-sensing; Unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing; Urban development; Urban river; Water quality inversion; Water quality parameters; Water quality; chlorophyll a; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; machine learning; polymorphism; remote sensing; turbidity; water quality",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 2008085QD188, 41901282, 41971311; Anhui Provincial Key Research and Development Plan: 202104b11020022; Major Science and Technology Projects in Anhui Province: 201903a07020014","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 41901282 and 41971311 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of Anhui (grant number 2008085QD188 ), Science and Technology Major Project of Anhui Province (grant No. 201903a07020014), Key Research and Development Project of Anhui Province (grant number 202104b11020022) and supported by Engineering Center for Geographic Information of Anhui Province.",,,,,,,,,,"Hoekstra, A.Y., Buurman, J., van Ginkel, K.C.H., Urban water security: a review (2018) Environ.

In this study, the online sequential extreme learning machine, M5 Prime tree, multilayer perceptron artificial neural network, response surface methodology, and multivariate adaptive regression spline models were investigated for daily chlorophyll a concentration prediction by assessing the relations between Chl-a and several water quality parameters, including water temperature, pH, specific conductance, and turbidity. Different scenarios based on TE, pH, SC, and TU were defined. Also, this study evaluated the influence of periodicity input as the last scenario to obtain more accurate predictions of Chl-a values. Daily data measured for 2009–2019 from USGS no. 14207200 and USGS no. 14211720 stations were used. For assessing the prediction performance of the proposed techniques, three different objective indicators were employed, namely RMSE, R2, and NSE. Moreover, the Taylor diagram was employed for evaluating the accuracy and generalization capability of the applied models for the prediction of Chl-a. Results indicated that OS-ELM with input parameters of TE, pH, SC, TU, Y (year), M (month), and D (day) showed higher accuracy in predicting Chl-a with RMSE of 3.151, NSE of 0.798, and R of 0.894 for USGS no. 14207200 and with RMSE of 0.907, NSE of 0.820, and R of 0.912 for USGS no. 14211720 than the other models, respectively. Additionally, MLPNN ranked as the second best method for the estimation of Chl-a values at both stations. As an interesting point, it was quite evident that adding periodicity as an input parameter could significantly enhance the performance of all models in predicting the daily Chl-a concentration at both stations. Results proved that OS-ELM models can be a reliable tool for the prediction of the Chl-a values in aquatic environments, benefiting ecological and environmental management, and algal bloom control. © 2021, Institute of Geophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences & Polish Academy of Sciences.","Chlorophyll a concentration;

The study aimed at retrieving and mapping water quality parameters (WQPs) of Owabi Dam reservoir from Sentinel-2 (S2) and Landsat 8 (L8) satellite data, using random forests (RF), support vector machines (SVM) and multiple linear regression (MLR) models. Water samples from 45 systematic plots were analysed for pH, turbidity, alkalinity, total dissolved solids and dissolved oxygen. The performances of all three models were compared in terms of adjusted coefficient of determination (R2.adj), and the root mean square error (RMSE) using repeated k-fold cross-validation procedure. To determine the status of water quality, pixel-level predictions were used to compute model-assisted estimates of WQPs and compared with reference values from the World Health Organization. Generally, all three models produced more accurate results for S2 compared to L8. On average, the inter-sensor relative efficiency showed that S2 outperformed L8 by 67% in retrieving WQPs of the Owabi Dam reservoir. S2 gave the highest accuracy for RF (R2.adj = 95–99%, RMSE = 0.02–3.03) and least for MLR (R2.adj = 55–91%, RMSE = 0.03–3.14). Compared to RF, SVM showed similar results for S2 but with slightly higher RMSEs (0.03–3.99). The estimated pH (7.06), total dissolved solids (39.19 mg/L) and alkalinity (179.60 mg/L) were within acceptable limits, except for turbidity (33.49 mg/L) which exceeded the reference thresholds. The S2 and RF models are recommended for the monitoring of surface water quality of the Owabi Dam reservoir. © 2021 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences","Machine learning models; Optical satellite image data; Owabi Reservoir; Water quality","Alkalinity; Biochemical oxygen demand; Decision trees; Dissolution; Dissolved oxygen; Linear regression; Mapping; Mean square error; pH; Predictive analytics; Reservoir management; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Surface waters; Turbidity; Water quality; Coefficient of determination; K fold cross validations; Machine learning models; Multiple linear regression models; Root mean square errors; Total dissolved solids; Water quality parameters; World Health Organization; Reservoirs (water); machine learning; mapping; numerical model; prediction; reservoir; satellite data; satellite imagery; spatial analysis; water quality",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abdelmalik, K.W., Role of statistical remote sensing for Inland water quality parameters prediction (2018) Egypt.

Most of these studies lack a strategy to determine the water turbidity for new samples, focusing mainly on one particular device. Nevertheless, widespread use of these approaches requires a predictive capacity on out-of-the-sample images acquired in devices of different capabilities. We studied the influence of mobile device camera sensors on the predictive performance of water turbidity for non-previously observed turbid images. For this, a reference database with turbid images acquired for different mobile devices was constructed. A machine learning method based on image quality measures and linear classifiers (least squares and LASSO) was proposed to perform predictions on each mobile device. Relative accuracy and precision were evaluated. Results suggest that these approaches may provide accurate predictions reaching most than 80% of relative accuracy with high test-retest reliability (. 0.99). Nevertheless, our results also indicate that the predictive performance levels dropped in low capacity quality sensors. Therefore, despite the high performance that can be reached using these approaches, widespread use on multiple mobile devices may require further development of low-quality sensors and a better understanding of their operative ranges. © 2021 IWA Publishing.

The method enables us to fill nearshore data voids in existing Kd data sets and provides a more direct measurement approach than methods based on passive multispectral satellite imagery. Furthermore, in contrast to other lidar-based methods, it does not rely on extensive signal processing or the availability of the system impulse response function, and it is designed to be applied globally rather than at a specific geographic location. The model was tested usingKd measurements from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite sensor at 94 coastal sites spanning the globe, with Kd values ranging from 0.05 to 3.6 m-1. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the approach and serve as a benchmark for future machine- learning regression studies of turbidity using ICESat-2. © 2021 American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.",,"Decision trees; Impulse response; NASA; Radiometers; Satellite imagery; Thermography (imaging); Turbidity; Data set; Data voids; Diffuse attenuation coefficients; Downwelling irradiance; National aeronautic and space administrations; Nearshores; Random forests; Space-borne; Space-borne lidar; Water turbidity; Optical radar; atlas; downwelling; ICESat; lidar; regression analysis; satellite imagery; signal processing; turbidity; VIIRS",,,,,"National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA: 80NSSC20K0964, UTA20-000752; Graduate School, University of Texas, Austin; Oregon State University, OSU","Funding for this research was provided by NASA ROSES Grant 80NSSC20K0964, “ICESat-2 Bathymetric Studies, Product Development and Data Validation,” and subaward UTA20-000752 from Applied Research Laboratories, The University of Texas at Austin, to Oregon State University.

This has been related to an increase in the appearance of algal blooms, which can produce organic compounds that can be toxic or can affect the organoleptic characteristics of the water, such as its taste and odor. Among these latter compounds is geosmin, a metabolite produced by certain cyanobacteria that confers an earthy taste to water and which can be detected by humans at very low concentrations (nanogram per liter). The difficulty and cost of both monitoring the presence of this compound and its treatment is a problem for drinking water treatment companies, as the appearance of geosmin affects consumer confidence in the quality of the drinking water they supply. In this field study, the evaluation of four sampling sites with different physicochemical conditions located in the upper part of the Ter River basin, a Mediterranean river located in Catalonia (NE Spain), has been carried out, with the aim of identifying the main triggers of geosmin episodes. The results, obtained from 1 year of sampling, have made it possible to find out that: (i) land uses with a higher percentage of agricultural and industrial activity are related to high nutrient conditions in river water, (ii) these higher nutrient concentrations favor the development of benthic cyanobacteria, (iii) in late winter–early spring, when these cyanobacteria are subjected to both an imbalance of the dissolved inorganic nitrogen and soluble reactive phosphorus ratio, guided by a phosphorus concentration increase, and to cold–mild temperatures close to 10°C, they produce and release geosmin, and (iv) 1–2 weeks after cyanobacteria reach a high relative presence in the whole biofilm, an increase in geosmin concentration in water is observed, probably associated with the cyanobacteria detachment from cobbles and consequent cell lysis. These results could serve as a guide for drinking water treatment companies, indicating under what conditions they can expect the appearance of geosmin episodes and implement the appropriate treatment before it reaches consumers’ tap. © Copyright © 2021 Espinosa, Abril, Bretxa, Jutglar, Ponsá, Sellarès, Vendrell-Puigmitjà, Llenas, Ordeix and Proia.","biofilm; cyanobacteria; field study; geosmin; global change; Mediterranean river","chlorophyll; drinking water; geosmin; ground water; algal bloom; aquatic environment; Article; biofilm; climate change; cold stress; consumer; cyanobacterium; cytolysis; diatom; electric conductance; electric conductivity; fluorometry; freshwater environment; global change; industrialization; land use; limit of detection; limit of quantitation; machine learning; marine environment; mass fragmentography; microbial community; nutrient concentration; oxidation reduction potential; oxygen saturation; pH; photosynthesis; river basin; sampling; sea surface temperature; seasonal variation; spring; temperature; turbidimetry; turbidity; volatilization; winter",,"chlorophyll, 1406-65-1, 15611-43-5; geosmin, 19700-21-1",,"Merck Millipore, United States","689341; 801370; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; H2020 European Research Council, ERC; es:CEI; fr:CER; pl:ERBN; European Research Council, ERC","We would like to acknowledge the water utilities Aigües de Vic S.A. and Aigües d’Osona S.A.

Due to the discharges of wastewater from the various point and nonpoint sources, most of the watersheds are contaminated easily. The Upper Green River watershed in Kentucky, USA, is one such watershed that is contaminated over the years due to the runoff from rural areas and agricultural lands and combined sewer overflows (CSOs) from urban areas. Monitoring and characterizing the water quality status of streams in such watersheds has become of great importance, with multivariate statistical techniques such as regression, factor analysis, cluster analysis, and artificial intelligence methods such as artificial neural networks (ANNs). The water quality parameters, namely, fecal coliform (FC), turbidity, pH, and conductivity have been predicted quantitatively using ANNs to understand the water quality status of streams in the Upper Green River watershed elsewhere. In this study, a novel attempt has been made to predict the status of the quality of the Green River water with the predictive capabilities of a few decision tree (DT) algorithms such as classification and regression tree (CART) model, multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) model, random forest (RF) model, and extreme learning machine (ELM) model. The RF model's performance is better in predicting FC, turbidity, and pH than CART models in training and testing phases. Relatively, MARS and ELM models did better in testing though the performance is poorer in training. For example, we obtain the RMSE values of 2206, 2532, 1533, and 1969 using RF, CART, MARS, and ELM for FC in testing. A good correlation has been observed between conductivity and temperature, precipitation, and land-use factors for the MARS model. Overall, DT models are helpful in understanding, interpreting the outcomes, and visualizing the results compared with the other models. Practitioner points: The prediction of stream water quality parameters using decision trees is explored. The climate and land use parameters are used as input parameters to the modeling. The DT models of CART, MARS, RF, and ANNs such as ELM are explored to predict stream water quality. The RF model shows stable results compared with CART, MARS, and ELM for the data explored. Apart from the R2 value, RMSE and MAE indicate the effectiveness of DTs in prediction. © 2021 Water Environment Federation","classification and regression tree (CART); conductivity; extreme learning machine (ELM);

Traditional monitoring via the use of field measurements lacks the spatial coverage necessary for detailed analysis in large-area lakes. In contrast, the macroscopic, real-time monitoring of CSPM can be achieved using data from remote-sensing satellites. Due to the major limitations of the existing analytical and semi-analytical algorithms, namely the lake locations and limited data, regression algorithms have become important tools for the analysis of the CSPM values in lakes. The purpose of this study is the evaluation of both parametric and nonparametric regression algorithms for CSPM estimation based on the simulation of Gaofen-1 (GF-1) wide field-of-view (WFV) satellites for the imaging of turbid water. A total of 71 samples collected during four cruises were analyzed to determine the spectral reflectance and CSPM in Poyang Lake. The results indicate that the spectral ratio (SR) parametric regression model and the extreme learning machine (ELM) nonparametric regression model based on in situ SPM and spectral data perform relatively better than the other investigated models. A SR fitting model using band3 (λ = 660 nm)/band2 (λ = 555 nm) of the GF-1 WFV sensor was established to estimate the CSPM value. The evaluation results indicate that the SR model achieved a high retrieval accuracy (R2 = 0.901, RMSE = 8.22 mg·L−1); this is because the model was more sensitive and could effectively weaken, and even partially eliminate, the effects of external factors. The ELM model achieved a higher retrieval accuracy (R2 = 0.903, RMSE = 8.05 mg·L−1) than the other neural network-based algorithms, namely the backpropagation (BP), radial basis function (RBF), and cascade-forward neural network (CFNN) algorithms. The ELM model is well suited for both low and high turbidity, and has a robust ability to accurately retrieve the CSPM value. In Poyang Lake, the CSPM values were found to have a spatial characteristic and were higher in the northern waters than in the southern waters. Overall, this study demonstrates the applicability of GF-1 WFV sensors with an advanced spatial resolution and an increased spectral sensitivity for monitoring the CSPM values in high-turbidity water, and the ELM model is recommended for application to GF-1 images to satisfactorily produce quantitative CSPM maps. © 2021, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.","Gaofen-1; Neural network; Poyang Lake; Suspended particulate matter; Turbid water","algorithm; detection method; estimation method; particulate matter; reflectance; satellite sensor; spatial resolution; spectral reflectance; suspended load; suspended particulate matter; turbidite; turbidity; China; Jiangxi; Poyang Lake; Satellites",,,,,"Education Department of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region: GJJ170979; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 41461080, 51869012; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province: 20171ACB21051, 20192ACBL20041; Key Research and Development Project of Hainan Province: 20201BBG71002","We thank the China Centre for Resources Satellite Data and Application for providing GF-1 WFV data.

The variations in the measured physico-chemical parameters were found as follows: conductivity 62–989 (µS/cm), turbidity 0.94–10.86 (NTU), pH 6–8.4, TDS 40–830 (mg/L), hardness 30–305 (mg/L), Ca2+ 35–135 (mg/L), K+ 2–12.2 (mg/L), Mg2+ 0–17.9 (mg/L), Na+ 2–27.6 (mg/L), Zn2+ 0–3.5 (mg/L), Cu2+ 0.27–3.51 (mg/L), Cl− 25–162 (mg/L), SO42− 0–83 (mg/L), NO3− 0–0.94 (mg/L), and HCO3− 15–327 (mg/L). The ion charge balance error was found within the range of ±10% with a mean value of 5.36%. The Gibbs plot and ionic ratios showed that the rock-weathering, especially carbonate dissolution, was the major hydrogeochemical process that influenced water chemistry. The water samples were classified as excellent (56%), good (40%), and medium (4%) quality based on the entropy water quality index (EWQI). The specificity and sensitivity of the discriminant model were found 100% and 90% respectively with a model-hit-ratio of 95.8% which satisfied this analysis. © 2021 CIWEM.","classification; EWQI; physico-chemical indicators;

In addtion a bibliographic review of practices over the past two decades, was presented and attained result were compared. More than 80 journal articles from 2001 to 2021 were review in terms of characteristics and capabilities of developing methods, considering data of input-output, etc. From the reviewed studies, it could be concluded that in spite of various weaknesses, if the artificial intelligence approaches were appropriately built, they can effectively be utilized for predicting the GWQ in various aquifers. Because many steps of applying AI methods are based on trial-and-error or experience procedures, it’s helpful to review them regarding the special application for GWQ modeling. Several partial and general findings were attained from the reviewed studies that could deliver relevant guidelines for scholars who intend to carry out related work. Many new ideas in the associated area of research are also introduced in this work to develop innovative approaches and to improve the quality of prediction water quality in groundwater for example, it has been found that the combined AI models with metaheuristic optimization are more reliable in capturing the nonlinearity of water quality parameters. However, in this review few papers were found that used these hybrid models in GWQ modeling. Therefore, for future works, it is recommended to use hybrid models to more furthere investigation and enhance the reliability and accuracy of predicting in GWQ. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","ANFIS;

Stormwater and wastewater effluent enter Lake Mead—an important drinking water source in the southwest USA—via the Las Vegas Wash. Previous studies have applied machine learning and online instruments to detect contamination in water distribution systems. However, alert systems at drinking water intakes would provide more time for corrective action. An array of online instruments measuring pH, conductivity, redox potential, turbidity, temperature, tryptophan-like fluorescence, UV absorbance (UVA254), TOC, and chlorophyll-a was fed raw water directly from Lake Mead. Wastewater effluent, dry weather Las Vegas Wash, and storm-impacted Las Vegas Wash samples were blended into the instrument inlets at known ratios to simulate three types of adverse water quality events. Data preprocessing was conducted to correct for diurnal patterns or instrument drift. Supervised machine learning was conducted using previously published models in R. Ninety-nine models were screened on the raw data. Eight high-performing models were evaluated in-depth and optimized. Weighted k-Nearest Neighbors, Single C5.0 Ruleset, Mixture Discriminant Analysis, and an ensemble of these three models had accuracy over 97% when assigning test set data among three classes (Normal, Event, or Maintenance). The ensemble detected all event types at the earliest timepoint and had one false positive that was not a lag error (i.e., consecutively following a true positive). Omitting Maintenance, the Adaboost model had over 99% test set accuracy and zero false positives that were not lag errors. Data preprocessing was beneficial, but the optimal methods were model-specific. All nine water quality variables were useful for most models, but UVA254 and turbidity were most important. © 2021","Artificial intelligence; Big data; De facto reuse; Fault diagnosis; Principle component analysis; Support vector machine","Effluents; Failure analysis; Lakes; Nearest neighbor search; Online systems; Potable water; Principal component analysis; Redox reactions; Storms; Support vector machines; Water distribution systems; De facto reuse; Drinking water sources; Faults diagnosis; Lake meads; Las vegas washes; On-line instruments; Principle components analysis; Stormwaters; Support vectors machine; Wastewater effluents; Water quality; chlorophyll a; drinking water; river water; storm water; surface water; tryptophan; water; detection method; effluent; instrumentation; machine learning; simulation; stormwater; surface water; total organic carbon; Article; artificial intelligence; big data; classification; conductance; data accuracy; decision tree; defacto reuse; discriminant analysis; effluent; false positive result; feature extraction; fluorescence; k nearest neighbor; lake; least squares support vector machine; light absorption; machine learning; mixture discriminant analysis; oxidation reduction potential; periodicity; pH; principal component analysis; random forest; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; simulation; single C5 0 ruleset; storm (weather); supervised machine learning; support vector machine; temperature; turbidity; United States; urban area; waste water recycling; wastewater; water contamination; water quality; water sampling; water supply; environmental monitoring; machine learning; wastewater; water management; United States; Environmental Monitoring; Machine Learning; Waste Water; Water; Water Purification; Water Quality",,"chlorophyll a, 479-61-8; tryptophan, 6912-86-3, 73-22-3; water, 7732-18-5; Waste Water; Water",,,"Bureau of Reclamation, USBR: BOR-DO-17-F010","This project was funded in part by the US Bureau of Reclamation , Funding Opportunity No. BOR-DO-17-F010 .

In this study, four stand-alone models including multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF), and four hybrid models based on wavelet transform (WT) including WT-MLR, WT-SVM, WT-ANN and WT-RF were used to predict the daily dissolved oxygen (DO) at 1–5-day lead times in the Dongjiang River Basin, China. To make the prediction robust, the maximal information coefficient (MIC) was used to capture comprehensive information between DO and explanatory variables. The 5-fold cross validation grid search approach was used to optimize parameters of machine learning tools. Two types of frameworks of WT: direct framework (i.e., only the explanatory variables were decomposed) and multicomponent framework (i.e., both explanatory variables and target variables were decomposed) were used to construct hybrid models. The results show that MIC extracts four optimal explanatory variables: previous DO, water temperature, air temperature and air pressure. Four evaluation parameters including correlation coefficient (R), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) indicate that the prediction accuracy decreases as the lead time changes from 1 to 5 days. In terms of the stand-alone models, MLR model outperforms the other three models with higher NSE values of 0.616–0.921, and lower RMSE values of 0.503–1.111. With regard to the hybrid models, WT-ANN and WT-MLR models exhibit higher performance, and multicomponent framework performs better than direct framework in all hybrid models. In general, the multicomponent framework of WT can improve the prediction accuracy of stand-alone models at a certain degree, while the direct framework shows no obvious advantage. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Dissolved oxygen prediction; Dongjiang river basin; Hybrid models; Stand-alone models; Wavelet transform","ammonia; dissolved oxygen; nitrogen; phosphorus; oxygen; artificial neural network; correlation; dissolved oxygen; error analysis; numerical model; support vector machine; time series analysis; water resource; wavelet analysis; air pressure; air temperature; Article; artificial neural network; China; correlation coefficient; cross validation; electric conductivity; evaporation; explanatory variable; flow; humidity; hybrid; multiple linear regression analysis; pH; precipitation; random forest; river basin; support vector machine; target variable; turbidity; water quality; water temperature; wavelet transform; wind speed; river; statistical model; China; Dongjiang Basin; Guangdong; China; Linear Models; Neural Networks, Computer; Oxygen; Rivers",,"ammonia, 14798-03-9, 51847-23-5, 7664-41-7; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; oxygen, 7782-44-7; Oxygen",,,"2017–28; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 51861125203, U1911204; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC: 2017YFC0405900","The research is financially supported by National Key R&D Program of China ( 2017YFC0405900 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants 51861125203 and U1911204 ), Research program of Guangzhou Water Authority (Grant 2017–28 ), and the Project for Creative Research from Guangdong Water Resources Department (Grant 2019 ).",,,,,,,,,,"Ahmed, A., Prediction of dissolved oxygen in Surma River by biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand using the artificial neural networks (ANNs) (2017) J.

Box 7631885356, Kerman, Iran","The quality of surface waters plays a key role in the sustainability of ecological systems. Measuring water quality parameters (WQPs) is of high importance in the management of surface water resources. In this paper, contemporary-developed regression analysis was proposed to estimate the hard-to-measure parameters from those that can be measured easily. To this end, we proposed a novel modification of support vector regression (SVR), known as multiple-kernel support vector regression (MKSVR) algorithm. The MKSVR learns an optimal data representation for regression analysis by either linear or nonlinear combination of some precomputed kernels. For solving the optimization problem of the MKSVR, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was used. The proposed algorithm was assessed using WQPs taken from Karun River, Iran. MKSVR was used to estimate chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) using nine WQPs as the input variables, namely electrical conductivity, sodium, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, nitrite, nitrate nitrogen, turbidity, and pH. The results of the proposed MKSVR were compared with those obtained using the SVR and Random Forest regression (RFR). The results showed that the MKSVR algorithm (correlation coefficient [R] = 0.8 and root mean squared error [RMSE] = 4.76 mg/l) increased the accuracy level of BOD prediction when compared with SVR (R = 0.68 and RMSE = 5.15 mg/l) and RFR (R = 0.77 and RMSE = 5.15 mg/l). In the case of COD estimation, the performance of a developed support vector machine (SVM) technique was satisfying. Overall, the use of MKSVR along with the PSO algorithm could demonstrate the superiority of the newly developed SVM technique for the WQPs estimation in the natural streams. © 2021, International Association for Mathematical Geosciences.","Kernel learning; Multi-kernel learning; Natural water resources; Regression analysis; Support vector regression; Water quality parameters",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abbasnejad, M.E., Ramachandram, D., Mandava, R., A survey of the state of the art in learning the kernels (2012) Knowledge and Information Systems, 31 (2), pp. 193-221; Ahmadianfar, I., Jamei, M., Chu, X., A novel hybrid wavelet-locally weighted linear regression (W-LWLR) model for electrical conductivity (EC) prediction in surface water (2020) Journal of Contaminant Hydrology, 232, p. 103641; Ay, M., Kisi, O., Modeling of dissolved oxygen concentration using different neural network techniques in Foundation Creek, El Paso County, Colorado (2011) Journal of Environmental Engineering, 138 (6), pp. 654-662; Bansal, J.C., Singh, P., Saraswat, M., Verma, A., Jadon, S.S., Abraham, A., Inertia weight strategies in particle swarm optimization (2011) 11 Third World Congress on Nature and Biologically Inspired Computing (Nabic)S, pp. 633-640; Bozorg-Haddad, O., Soleimani, S., Loáiciga, H.A., Modeling water-quality parameters using genetic algorithm–least squares support vector regression and genetic programming (2017) Journal of Environmental Engineering, 143 (7), p. 04017021; Bucak, S.S., Jin, R., Jain, A.K., Multiple kernel learning for visual object recognition: A review (2014) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 36 (7), pp. 1354-1369; Camps-Vails, G., Bruzzone, L., Rojo-Álvarez, J., Melgani, F., Robust support vector regression for biophysical variable estimation from remotely sensed images (2006) IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, 3 (3), pp. 339-344; Learning non-linear combinations of kernels (2009) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 396-404; Cortes, C., Vapnik, V., Support-vector networks (1995) Machine Learning, 20 (3), pp. 273-297; Emamgholizadeh, S., Kashi, H., Marofpoor, I., Zalaghi, E., Prediction of water quality parameters of Karoon River (Iran) by artificial intelligence-based models (2014) International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, 11 (3), pp. 645-656; Gonen, M., Alpaydin, E., Localized multiple kernel regression (2010) 2010 20Th International Conference on Pattern Recognition, pp. 1425-1428. , IEEE; Gönen, M., Alpaydın, E., Multiple kernel learning algorithms (2011) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 12, pp. 2211-2268; Gunn, S.R., Support vector machines for classification and regression (1998) ISIS Technical Report, 14 (1), pp. 5-16; Heddam, S., Kisi, O., Modelling daily dissolved oxygen concentration using least square support vector machine, multivariate adaptive regression splines and M5 model tree (2018) Journal of Hydrology, 559, pp. 499-509; Jamei, M., Ahmadianfar, I., Chu, X., Yaseen, Z.M., Prediction of surface water total dissolved solids using hybridized wavelet-multigene genetic programming: New approach (2020) Journal of Hydrology, 589, p. 125335; Jamei, M., Ahmadianfar, I., A rigorous model for prediction of viscosity of oil-based hybrid nanofluids (2020) Physica A Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 556, p. 124827; Jamei, M., Ahmadianfar, I., Olumegbon, I.A., Karbasi, M., Asadi, A., On the assessment of specific heat capacity of nanofluids for solar energy applications: Application of Gaussian process regression (GPR) approach (2021) Journal of Energy Storage, 33, p. 102067; Kloft, M., Brefeld, U., Sonnenburg, S., Zien, A., Lp-norm multiple kernel learning (2011) The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 12, pp. 953-997; Li, X., Sha, J., Wang, Z.-L., A comparative study of multiple linear regression, artificial neural network and support vector machine for the prediction of dissolved oxygen (2017) Hydrology Research, 48 (5), pp. 1214-1225; Mukherjee, S., Osuna, E., Girosi, F., Nonlinear prediction of chaotic time series using support vector machines (1997) Neural Networks for Signal Processing [1997] VII.

Although turbid water column corrections can be applied on regions with seasonal turbidity by performing multi-temporal analysis, different approaches are needed in regions where the water is constantly turbid or only exhibits subtle turbidity variations through time. This study aims to detect these turbid zones (TZs) in optically shallow coastal waters using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 surface reflectance datasets to improve the aforementioned studies. The herein framework can be paired with other aquatic ecology remote sensing studies to establish the clear water focus area and can also be used by decision makers to identify rehabilitation areas. We selected the coastlines of Guinea-Bissau, Tunisia, and west Madagascar as our case studies which feature wide-ranging turbidity intensities across tropical, subtropical, and Mediterranean waters and applied three different methods for the TZ detection: Otsu’s method for bimodal thresholding, linear spectral unmixing, and Random Forest (RF) machine learning method on Google Earth Engine as an end-to-end process. Based on our experiments, the RF method yields good results in all study regions with overall accuracies ranging between 88 and 96% and F1-scores between 0.87 and 0.96. TZ detection is highly site-specific due to the inter-class variability that is mainly affected by the nature of the suspended materials and the environmental characteristics of the site. © Copyright © 2021 Pertiwi, Lee and Traganos.","Google Earth Engine; machine learning; multi-temporal data; Sentinel-2; spectral unmixing; turbidity",,,,,,"Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst, DAAD: 57478193; Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt, DLR","AP and DT acknowledge funding for their efforts from the German Aerospace Center (DLR) through the Global Seagrass Watch project.

Poor water quality has an impact not just on aquatic life but also on the ecosystem. The purpose of this systematic review is to identify peer-reviewed literature on the effectiveness of applying machine learning (ML) methodologies to estimate water quality parameters with satellite data. The data was gathered using the Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE citation databases. Related articles were extracted, selected, and evaluated using advanced keyword search and the PRISMA approach. The bibliographic information from publications written in journals during the previous two decades were collected. Publications that applied ML to water quality parameter retrieval with a focus on the application of satellite data were identified for further systematic review. A search query of 1796 papers identified 113 eligible studies. Popular ML models application were artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVM), regression, cubist, genetic programming (GP) and decision tree (DT). Common water quality parameters extracted were chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), temperature, salinity, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), suspended solids and turbidity. According to the systematic analysis, ML can be successfully extended to water quality monitoring, allowing researchers to forecast and learn from natural processes in the environment, as well as assess human impacts on an ecosystem. These efforts will also help with restoration programs to ensure that environmental policy guidelines are followed. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Diersing, N, Keys, F, Marine, N, Water quality: frequently asked questions (2009) Florida Keys Natl.

Nevertheless, most of the indices are not applicable to all water types as these are dependent on core physico-chemical water parameters that can make them biased and sensitive towards specific attributes including: (i) time, location and frequency for data sampling; (ii) number, variety and weights allocation of parameters. Therefore, there is a need to evaluate these indices to eliminate uncertainties that make them unpredictable and which may lead to manipulation of the water quality classes. The present study calculated five WQIs for two temporal periods: (i) June to December 2019 obtained in real time (using the Internet of Things (IoT) nodes) at inlet and outlet streams of Rawal Dam; (ii) 2012-2019 obtained from the Rawal Dam Water Filtration Plant, collected through GIS-based grab sampling. The computed WQIs categorized the collected datasets as 'Very Poor', primarily owing to the uneven distribution of the water samples that has led to class imbalance in the data. Additionally, this study investigates the classification of water quality using machine learning algorithms namely: Decision Tree (DT), k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression (LogR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Naive Bayes (NB); based on the parameters including: pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, turbidity, fecal coliform and temperature. The classification results showed that the DT algorithm outperformed other models with a classification accuracy of 99%. Although WQI is a popular method used to assess the water quality, there is a need to address the uncertainties and biases introduced by the limitations of data acquisition (such as specific location/area, type and number of parameters or water type) leading to class imbalance. This can be achieved by developing a more refined index that considers various other factors such as topographical and hydrological parameters with spatial temporal variations combined machine learning techniques to effectively contribute in estimation of water quality for all regions. © 2021 The Authors Water Supply","Decision tree; IoT; Machine learning; Physico-chemical; Water quality index; Water quality monitoring","Biochemical oxygen demand; Data acquisition; Decision trees; Dissolved oxygen; Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Logistic regression; Machine learning; Multilayer neural networks; Nearest neighbor search; Parameter estimation; Quality control; Uncertainty analysis; Water filtration; Water quality; Classification accuracy; Classification results; Hydrological parameters; Internet of thing (IOT); K nearest neighbor (KNN); Machine learning techniques; Multi layer perceptron; Water quality indexes; Water pollution; dissolved oxygen; dam; data acquisition; detection method; fecal coliform; machine learning; physicochemical property; spatiotemporal analysis; water pollution; water quality; algorithm; Article; Bayesian learning; chemical parameters; controlled study; decision tree; environmental parameters; information processing; internet of things; k nearest neighbor; logistic regression analysis; machine learning; multilayer perceptron; Pakistan; pH; turbidity; water filtration; water monitoring; water pollution; water quality; Pakistan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abbasnia, A., Yousefi, N, Mahvi, A.

Here, we developed a machine learning algorithm using a low-cost computer. We trained a convolutional neural network and tested its performance in: (1) distinguishing focal organisms of three marine taxa (Australian fur seals, loggerhead sea turtles and Australasian gannets; body size ranges: 0.8–2.5 m, 0.6–1.0 m, and 0.8–0.9 m, respectively); and (2) simultaneously delineating the fine-scale movement trajectories of multiple sea turtles at a fish cleaning station. For all species, the algorithm performed best at detecting individuals of similar body length, displaying consistent behaviour or occupying uniform habitat (proportion of individuals detected, or recall of 0.94, 0.79 and 0.75 for gannets, seals and turtles, respectively). For gannets, performance was impacted by spacing (huddling pairs with offspring) and behaviour (resting vs. flying shapes, overall precision: 0.74). For seals, accuracy was impacted by morphology (sexual dimorphism and pups), spacing (huddling and creches) and habitat complexity (seal sized boulders) (overall precision: 0.27). For sea turtles, performance was impacted by habitat complexity, position in water column, spacing, behaviour (interacting individuals) and turbidity (overall precision: 0.24); body size variation had no impact. For sea turtle trajectories, locations were estimated with a relative positioning error of <50 cm. In conclusion, we demonstrate that, while the same machine learning algorithm can be used to survey multiple species, no single algorithm captures all components optimally within a given site. We recommend that, rather than attempting to fully automate detection of UAV imagery data, semi-automation is implemented (i.e. part automated and part manual, as commonly practised for photo-identification). Approaches to enhance the efficiency of manual detection are required in parallel to the development of effective implementation of machine learning algorithms. © 2021 Deakin Univeristy.

Quality of water serves as a powerful environmental determinant and a foundation for the prevention and control of waterborne diseases. The project aims to design a water quality prediction system using Machine learning based on the water standards suggested by BIS to prevent deaths due to water related diseases. The quality is predicted based on parameters such as pH, Temperature, TDS, Turbidity and Conductivity value. The dataset is preprocessed and split into test and training data. The data is fed into regression algorithm and been evaluated. Sensors that can measure the water parameters are also been implemented. A webpage interfaced with the Machine Learning model is created to upload sensor values and the corresponding water quality is predicted. This project can be used in urban areas to predict the quality of the drinking water thereby preventing the spread of diseases such as dysentery, typhoid and cholera due to consumption of contaminated water. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Disease control; Forecasting; Machine learning; Predictive analytics; Quality control; Statistical tests; Water pollution; Water quality; Environmental determinants; Machine learning models; Prevention and controls; Regression algorithms; Urban water qualities; Water quality predictions; Water-related disease; World Health Organization; Potable water",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Shamsul, Haq, Shoukat, Ara, Maqbool, Geelani Syed, Absar, Bhatt Asma, Assessment of surface and ground water for irrigational purposes (2016) International Journal of Applied And Pure Science and Agriculture, 2; Manish, Kumar, Gurmeet, Singh, Tushara, Chaminda, Pham, Van Quan, Keisuke, Kuroda, (2014) Emerging Water Quality Problems in Developing Countries The Scientific World Journal, , 2014; Roy, Ritabrata, An Introduction to water quality analysis (2018) International Journal for Environmental Rehabilitation and Conservation, 2018, pp. 94-100; Subodh, Kumar, Mohan, Meena Hari, Kavita, Verma, Water Pollution in India: Its Impact on the Human Health: Causes and Remedies (2017) International Journal of Applied Environmental Sciences, 12, pp. 275-279; Gopavanitha, K, Nagaraju, S, A low cost system for real time water quality monitoring and controlling using (2017) IOT International Conference on Energy, Communication, Data Analytics and Soft Computing (ICECDS); Brinda, Das, Jain, P C, (2017) Real-time water quality monitoring system using Internet of Things 2017 International Conference on Computer, Communications and Electronics (Comptelix); Kulkarni Vrushali, Y, Sinha Pradeep, K, Effective Learning and Classification using Random Forest Algorithm (2014) International Journal of Engineering and Innovative Technology (IJEIT), 3, pp. 45-53; Anna, Bosch, Andrew, Zisserman, Xavier, Munoz, (2007) Image Classification using Random Forests and Ferns IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision; Zawbaa Hossam, M, Maryam, Hazman, Mona, Abbass, Ella, Hassanien Aboul, Automatic fruit classification using random forest algorithm (2014) International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems; Gerard, Biau, Analysis of a Random Forests Model (2012) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 13, pp. 1063-1095; Umair, Ahmed, Rafia, Mumtaz, Hirra, Anwar, Shah Asad, A, Rabia, Irfan, Efficient Water Quality Prediction Using Supervised Machine Learning (2019) MDPI, 11, pp. 1-14; Breuss Martin Python Web Applications: Deploy Your Script as a Flask App, , https://realpython.com/python-web-applications/; Dyouri Abdelhadi How to Make a Web Application Using Flask in Python 3, , https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-make-a-web-application-using-flask-in-python-3; https://in.mathworks.com/help/thingspeak/; Kancheti, Spandana, Seshagiri Rao, V R, Internet of Things (IOT) Based Smart Water Quality Monitoring System (2018) International Journal of Engineering & Technology, 7, pp. 259-262; Vaishnavi, V D, Gaikwad, M A, Water Quality Monitoring System Based on IOT Advances in Wireless and Mobile (2017) Communications, 10, pp. 1107-1116; Suganya, P, Hariharan, S, IOT Based Water Quality Monitoring System Using Blynk App (2018) International Journal of Research in Advent Technology, 6; Gokulanathan, S, Manivasagam, P, Prabu, N, Venkatesh, T, A GSM Based Water Quality Monitoring System using Arduino Shanlax (2019) International Journal of Arts Science and Humanities, 6, pp. 22-26; Aziz, F A, Sarosa, M, Rohadi, E, Monitoring system water pH rate, turbidity, and temperature of river water (2020) IOP Conf.

For this reason, interest in the satellite remote sensing of OWTs has recently increased in recent years. This study develops a machine learning method for monitoring Brazilian OWTs using the Sentinel-2 MSI, which can detect OWTs already assessed by field measurements and recognize new OWTs. The already assessed OWTs used for calibrating the machine learning algorithm are clear, moderate turbid, eutrophic turbid, eutrophic clear, hypereutrophic, CDOM richest, turbid, and very turbid waters. The classification method consists of two Support Vector Machines for classifying the known OWTs, while a novelty detection method based on sigmoid functions is used for assessing new OWTs. Results show the classification based on Sentinel-2 MSI bands simulated using field radiometric data is accurate (accuracy = 0.94). However, when radiometric errors are simulated, the accuracy significantly decreases to 0.75, 0.56, 0.45, and 0.37 as the mean absolute percent error increases to 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40%, respectively. Considering the errors retrieved when comparing the field and satellite measurements, the expected accuracy of Sentinel-2 MSI images is 0.78. In the satellite images, the novelty detection distinguishes new OWTs originated from the mixture among the known OWTs and a new OWT that was not part of the training database (clear blue waters). Two examples of time series in the Funil reservoir and the Curuai lake are used to show the applicability of monitoring OWTs. In the Funil reservoir, OWTs could indicate eutrophication and turbid changes caused by river inflow and sediment sinking. In the Curuai lake, OWTs could indicate areas susceptible to algae bloom and turbidity increases related to river inflow and particle resuspension. In the future, the proposed algorithm could be used for large-scale assessment of water quality degradation and supports rapid mitigation and recovery responses. For improving the classification accuracy, adjacency correction and more robust glint removal methods should be developed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Classification; Machine learning; Novelty detection; Optical water type",,,,,,"1022114003005; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP: 2008/56252, 2014/23903; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES","This study was supported by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior—Brasil (CAPES) — Finance Code 001; the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) from projects no. 2014/23903–9 , 2013/09045–7 , 2012/19821–1 , and 2008/56252–0 , and the Monitoramento Ambiental por Satélites no Bioma Amazônia—Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econômico e Social (MSA-BNDES) from project no. 1022114003005 .","The SVM is a classification algorithm that creates a margin hyperplane in an n-dimensional space (number of bands) that separates two classes (OWTs) and maximizes this margin to the nearest support vectors (samples) of both OWTs. A kernel function defines the margin hyperplane, such as linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid, while the penalty factor (C) controls the distance from the margin hyperplane to the nearest support vectors. In practical terms, the lower the C (where C > 0), the higher the maximization of the distance between the margin hyperplane and the support vectors. Although the lowest C seems a reasonable choice, it may result in poor accuracy if the classes are not well separated (Tan et al., 2008). Hence, for choosing the optimal kernel function and C for both shape and intensity classification, we used grid search cross-validation with training (70%) and validation (30%) dataset splitting, with kernels varying among linear, polynomial, RBF, and sigmoid, and C varying from 1 to 100. The optimal parameters for both shape and intensity classification were the RBF kernel with C = 1. Furthermore, we estimated the SVM ? bandwidth as 1 - (number of features x matrix variance), resulting in 23 for the shape classification and 10,836 for the intensity classification.This study was supported by the Coordena??o de Aperfei?oamento de Pessoal de N?vel Superior?Brasil (CAPES)?

In order to monitor and map, the water quality for a wide range on different scales (spatial, temporal), the geospatial technique has the potential to minimize the field and laboratory work. The review has emphasized the advance of remote sensing for the effectiveness of spectral analysis, bio-optical estimation, empirical method, and application of machine learning for water quality assessment. The water quality parameters (turbidity, suspended particles, chlorophyll, etc.) and their retrieval techniques are described in a scientific manner. Available satellite, bands, resolution, and spectrum ranges for specific parameters are critically described in this review with challenges in remote sensing for water quality analysis, considering non-optical active parameters. The application of statistical programmes like linear (multiple regression analysis) and non-linear approaches is discussed for better assessment of water quality. Emphasis is given on comparison between different models to increase the accuracy level of remote sensing of water quality assessment. A direction is suggested for future development in the field of estimation of water pollution assessment through geospatial techniques. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bio-optical methods; Empirical methods; Inherent and apparent properties; Optically active constituents; Remote sensing; Water quality","Varanidae; chlorophyll; environmental monitoring; remote sensing; water pollution; water quality; Chlorophyll; Environmental Monitoring; Remote Sensing Technology; Water Pollution; Water Quality",,"chlorophyll, 1406-65-1, 15611-43-5; Chlorophyll",,,"National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, NEERI","Authors are thankful to the Director of CSIR-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), Nagpur, for providing the necessary infrastructure and support to carry out this study.",,,,,,,,,,"Abayazid, H.O., El-Adawy, A., Assessment of a non-optical water quality property using space-based imagery in Egyptian coastal lake (2019) Journal of Water Resource and Protection, 11, pp. 713-727; Ahn, Y.H., Shanmugam, P., Moon, J.E., Ryu, J.H., Satellite remote sensing of a low-salinity water plume in the East China Sea (2008) InAnnalesGeophysicae, 26, pp. 2019-2035. , Copernicus GmbH; Aiken, G.R., Humic substances in soil, sediment and water (1985) Geochemistry, isolation and characterization, 21, pp. 213-214; Akbar, T.A., Hassan, Q., Achari, G., A remote sensing based framework for predicting water quality of different source waters (2010) The International Archives of Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, 34, pp. 1-4; Allan, M.G., Hicks, B.J., Brabyn, L., (2007) Remote Sensing of Water Quality in the Rotorua Lakes, , https://hdl.handle.net/10289/3785; Alparslan, E., Aydöner, C., Tufekci, V., Tüfekci, H., Water quality assessment at Ömerli Dam using remote sensing techniques (2007) Environ Monit Assess, 135 (1), pp. 391-398; Álvarez-Robles, J.A., Zarazaga-Soria, F.J., Latre, M.A., Béjar, R., Muro-Medrano, P.R., Water quality monitoring based on sediment distribution using satellite imagery (2006) Proceedings of the 9Th AGILE Conference on Geographic Information Science, Visegrad, Hungary (Pp. 20-22).Approach.

We propose a machine-learning model to consider alkalinity, Ca, Mg, Na, Ba, Fe, Mn, Cl, sulfate, TDS, specific conductance, pH, temperature, and turbidity holistically together. The model, an ensemble of sub-models targeting one parameter pair per sub-model, was trained with groundwater chemistry from Pennsylvania (n=19,086) and a set of 16 analyses from putatively contaminated groundwater. For cases where [CH4] ≥ 10 mg/L, salinity- and redox-related parameters sometimes show that CH4 may have moved into the aquifer recently and separately from natural brine migration, i.e., anomalous CH4. We applied the model to validation and hold-out data for Pennsylvania (n=4,786) and groundwater data from three other gas-producing states: New York (n=203), Texas (n=688), and Colorado (n=10,258). The applications show that 1.4%, 1.3%, 0%, and 0.9% of tested samples in these four states, respectively, have high [CH4] and are ≥50% likely to have been impacted by gas migrated from exploited reservoirs. If our approach is indeed successful in flagging anomalous CH4, we conclude that: i) the frequency of anomalous CH4 (# flagged water samples / total samples tested) in the Appalachian Basin is similar in areas where gas wells target unconventional as compared to conventional reservoirs, and ii) the frequency of anomalous CH4 in Pennsylvania is higher than in Texas + Colorado. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that differences among regions might be affected by differences in data volumes. Machine learning models will become increasingly useful in informing decision-making for shale gas development. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","groundwater; machine learning; methane, redox, salinity; Shale gas","Alkalinity; Aquifers; Chemical analysis; Decision making; Gases; Groundwater pollution; Groundwater resources; Machine learning; Shale gas; Sulfur compounds; CH$-4$; Geochemical approaches; Hydrocarbon production; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Methane concentrations; Methane, redox, salinity; Pennsylvania; Production area; Submodels; Methane; barium; bicarbonate; calcium; calcium ion; chloride; ground water; hydrocarbon; iron; magnesium; manganese; methane; proton; sodium; sodium ion; sulfate; hydrocarbon; methane; natural gas; aquifer; concentration (composition); detection method; geochemistry; groundwater; groundwater chemistry; hydrocarbon generation; machine learning; methane; alkalinity; Article; Colorado; conductance; decision making; machine learning; migration; New York; Pennsylvania; pH; priority journal; temperature; Texas; turbidity; United States; water analysis; water temperature; environmental monitoring; oil and gas field; water pollutant; Appalachian Basin; Colorado; New York [United States]; Pennsylvania; Texas; United States; Colorado; Environmental Monitoring; Groundwater; Hydrocarbons; Methane; Natural Gas; New York; Oil and Gas Fields; Pennsylvania; Texas; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,"barium, 7440-39-3; bicarbonate, 144-55-8, 71-52-3; calcium, 7440-70-2, 14092-94-5; calcium ion, 14127-61-8; chloride, 16887-00-6; iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6; magnesium, 7439-95-4; manganese, 16397-91-4, 7439-96-5; methane, 74-82-8; proton, 12408-02-5, 12586-59-3; sodium, 7440-23-5; sodium ion, 17341-25-2; sulfate, 14808-79-8; natural gas, 8006-14-2; Hydrocarbons; Methane; Natural Gas; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: IIS-16-39150; U.S. Geological Survey, USGS: G16AP00079; Pennsylvania State University, PSU; Pennsylvania Center for Water Resources Research, WRRC","Funding was derived from the National Science Foundation IIS-16-39150 and US Geological Survey (104b award G16AP00079) through the Pennsylvania Water Resource Research Center to S.L.B. and Zhenhui Li.

Artificial intelligence (AI) based on machine learning techniques has been widely used to evaluate and classify water quality for the last two decades. However, traditional machine learning techniques face many limitations, the most important of which is the inability to apply these techniques with big data generated by smart water quality monitoring stations to improve the prediction. Real-time water quality monitoring with high accuracy and efficiency for intelligent water quality monitoring stations requires new and sophisticated techniques based on machine and deep learning techniques. For this purpose, we propose a novel approach based on the integration of deep learning and feature extraction techniques to improve water quality classification. In this paper, was chosen the Tilesdit dam in Bouira (Algeria) as a case study. Moreover, we implemented the advanced deep learning method - Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM RNNs) to construct an intelligent model for drinking water quality classification. Furthermore, principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and independent component analysis (ICA) techniques were used for features extraction and data reduction from original features. Additionally, we used three methods of cross-validation and two methods of the out-of-sample test to estimate the performance of LSTM RNNs model. From the results we found that the integration of LSTM RNNs with LDA, and LSTM RNNs with ICA yields an accuracy of 99.72%, using Random-Holdout technique. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Deep learning; Dimensionality reduction; Long short term memory recurrent neural networks; Support vector machines; Time series prediction; Water quality classification","alkali; bicarbonate; drinking water; magnesium; Algeria; Article; cross validation; dam (barrier); deep learning; dimensionality reduction; discriminant analysis; electric conductivity; feature extraction; feature selection; hardness; hold out cross validation; independent component analysis; long short term memory network; pattern recognition; pH; physical chemistry; principal component analysis; priority journal; statistics; support vector machine; temperature; turbidity; water monitoring; water quality",,"bicarbonate, 144-55-8, 71-52-3; magnesium, 7439-95-4",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"UNESCO International Water Conference, Leveraging inter sectorality for sustainable water security and peace (2019), https://en.unesco.org/events/unesco-international-water-conference-leveraging-intersectorality-sustainable-water-security, (Accessed 27 December 2019); Tripathi, M., Singal, S.K., Use of principal component analysis for parameter selection for development of a novel water quality index: a case study of river ganga India (2019) Ecol.

For drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs), violent fluctuations in turbidity are highly disruptive to operational performance due to the lag in process parameter adjustments. Such risks must be carefully managed to guarantee safe drinking water. Machine learning techniques have been proven to be effective for modeling complex nonlinear environmental systems, and this study adopted such a technique to develop a model for predicting source water turbidity for DWTPs to allow DWTPs to make proactive interventions in advance. A random forest (RF) model used preprocessed (empirical mode decomposition and quartile rejecting) meteorological factors (wind speed, wind direction, air temperature, and rainfall) as the input variables, to establish the turbidity prediction of a lake with significant turbidity in China's South Tai Lake. The modeling process included four main stages: (1) source data analysis, (2) raw data preprocessing, (3) modeling and tuning, and (4) model evaluation. The results of the RF model indicated that the correlation coefficient between the predicted and actual sequences is over 0.7, and more than 55% of the predicted values could control the errors within 20% compared to the actual measured values, suggesting that machine learning techniques are suitable for predicting the turbidity of raw source water. It was found that the RF model can provide a modest performance boost because of its stronger capacity to capture nonlinear interactions in the data. The findings of this study can inform the development of turbidity prediction models using readily available meteorological forecast data. The model can be applied to other DWTPs using similar shallow lakes as water sources. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Data-driven model; Drinking water source; Machine learning technique; Shallow lake; Wind field","water; algorithm; data set; decomposition analysis; detection method; environmental factor; lake water; machine learning; turbidity; water quality; water treatment; air temperature; Article; China; comparative study; controlled study; correlation coefficient; decomposition; fluid intake; intrinsic mode function; machine learning; meteorological phenomena; meteorology; particle resuspension; prediction; predictor variable; random forest; shear stress; suspended particulate matter; turbidity; waste water treatment plant; water quality; water supply; wind speed; environmental monitoring; lake; wind; Taihu Lake; China; Environmental Monitoring; Lakes; Water Quality; Wind",,"water, 7732-18-5",,,"2017ZX07201003; Basic Public Welfare Research Program of Zhejiang Province: GG21E080021","This work was financially supported by the National Science and Technology Major Projects for Water Pollution Control and Treatment (No. 2017ZX07201003 ) and the Zhejiang Public Welfare Technology Research Program (No. GG21E080021 ).",,,,,,,,,,"Aani, S.A., Bonny, T., Hasan, S.W., Hilal, N., Can machine language and artificial intelligence revolutionize process automation for water treatment and desalination ?

Though, the toxic effect of microplastics on human health is not yet well established; there is global concern about their possible ill effect on the human. Hence, the present study evaluates the occurrence of microplastics at different treatment stages of a typical DWTP with pulse clarification and its removal efficiency. In the test DWTP, raw water, sourced from river Ganga, was found to contain microplastics 17.88 items/L. Cumulative microplastic removal at key treatment stages viz. pulse clarification and sand filtration was found to be 63% and 85%, respectively. The study also revealed higher microplastic abundance on the sand filter bed due to the screening effect. The most frequently occurring microplastics were fibers and films/fragments with polyethylene terephthalate and polyethylene as a major chemical type. The t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding machine learning algorithm revealed a strong association between microplastic abundance with turbidity, phosphate and nitrate. The test DWTP with a pulse clarification system was having comparable microplastics removal efficiency with previously reported advanced DWTPs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Drinking water treatment plant; Microplastics; Pulse clarification; Removal efficiency","Aliphatic compounds; Clarification; Clarifiers; Efficiency; Embeddings; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Plastic bottles; Potable water; Stochastic systems; Water pollution; Water treatment; Water treatment plants; Aquatic environments; Different treatments; Microplastics; Removal efficiencies; Sand filtration; Screening effect; Stochastic neighbor embedding; Toxic effect; Microplastic; drinking water; microplastic; nitrate; phosphate; polyethylene; polyethylene terephthalate; river water; plastic; drinking water; machine learning; plastic; pollutant removal; turbidity; water treatment; water treatment plant; algorithm; Article; drinking water treatment plant; fluorescence microscopy; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; India; machine learning; microplastic pollution; physical chemistry; statistical analysis; stochastic model; t stochastic neighbor embedding; turbidity; water filtration; water quality; water treatment; environmental monitoring; human; water pollutant; Drinking Water; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Microplastics; Plastics; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,"nitrate, 14797-55-8; phosphate, 14066-19-4, 14265-44-2; polyethylene, 9002-88-4; polyethylene terephthalate, 25038-59-9, 60527-88-0, 9003-68-3; Drinking Water; Microplastics; Plastics; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,"Indian Council of Agricultural Research, ICAR: FREM/17-20/14","The authors are thankful to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), New Delhi, India for the monetary aid under the institute project FREM/17-20/14.",,,,,,,,,,"Ahirrao, S.D., Effect of a common water purifier potash alum on drinking water quality and human health (2008) Nat.

Moreover, usage of remote sensing approaches has not been broadly applied in monitoring routines. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the efficacy of available sensors to complement the often limited field measurements from such programs and build models that support monitoring tasks. Here, we integrate field measurements (2013–2019) from the Mexican national water quality monitoring system (RNMCA) with data from Landsat-8 OLI, Sentinel-3 OLCI, and Sentinel-2 MSI to train an extreme learning machine (ELM), a support vector regression (SVR) and a linear regression (LR) for estimating Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), Turbidity, Total Suspended Matter (TSM) and Secchi Disk Depth (SDD). Additionally, OLCI Level-2 Products for Chl-a and TSM are compared against the RNMCA data. We observed that OLCI Level-2 Products are poorly correlated with the RNMCA data and it is not feasible to rely only on them to support monitoring operations. However, OLCI atmospherically corrected data is useful to develop accurate models using an ELM, particularly for Turbidity (R2 =0.7). We conclude that remote sensing is useful to support monitoring systems tasks, and its progressive integration will improve the quality of water quality monitoring programs. © 2021 by the authors.

The prediction model developed in this study is designed to be used for monitoring the water quality in the Fei Tsui reservoir. High concentrations of total suspended solids (TSS) have been a crucial problem in the Fei Tsui reservoir for decades. As the Fei Tsui reservoir is a primary water source for Taipei City, this issue impacts the drinking water supply for the city due to etherification problems in the reservoir. 10-year average monthly records and 13-year average annual records have been collected for 26 parameters and correlated with the TSS concentrations to determine the parameters that have a strong relationship with the TSS concentrations. The parameters that were shown to have a strong correlation with the TSS concentration are the trophic state index (TSI), nitrate (NO3) concentration, total phosphorous (TP) concentration, iron concentration (IRON), and turbidity. Linear regression was used to develop the model that estimates the TSS concentration in the Fei Tsui Reservoir. The results show that model 3, a three-layer ANN model that uses three-input parameters namely NO3 concentration, TP concentration, and turbidity, with five neurons, to predict the output parameter which is TSS concentration, produces the highest coefficient of determination (R2) and Willmott Index (WI), which are 0.9589 and 0.9933 respectively, and the lowest root mean square error, which is 0.4753. Based on these performance criteria, model 3 is concluded as the best model to predict TSS concentrations in this study. © 2020 Faculty of Engineering, Ain Shams University","Machine learning algorithms; Time-series prediction and feitsui reservoir; Total suspended solids; Water quality","Forecasting; Iron; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Mean square error; Neural networks; Potable water; Reservoirs (water); Turbidity; Water quality; Water supply; Coefficient of determination; Iron concentrations; Output parameters; Performance criterion; Root mean square errors; Strong correlation; Total suspended solids; TSS concentration; Predictive analytics",,,,,"Universiti Tenaga Nasional: J5100D4103","The APC was funded by Innovation & Research Management Center (iRMC), Universiti Tenaga Nasional (UNITEN), Malaysia from BOLD Journal Publication Fund 2021 (J5100D4103).",,,,,,,,,,"Abobakr Yahya, A.S., Ahmed, A.N., Binti Othman, F., Ibrahim, R.K., Afan, H.A., El-Shafie, A., Water quality prediction model based support vector machine model for ungauged river catchment under dual scenarios (2019) Water, 11, p. 1231; Afan, H.A., Allawi, M.F., El-Shafie, A., Yaseen, Z.M., Ahmed, A.N., Malek, M.A., Input attributes optimization using the feasibility of genetic nature inspired algorithm: application of river flow forecasting (2020) Sci Rep, 10, pp. 1-16; Ahmed, A.N., El-Shafie, A., (2014), pp. 209-12. , An application Support Vector Machine model (SVM) technique for Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) prediction.

Adapting treatment process operations accordingly is challenging due to a lack of analytical capacity for characterization and monitoring at many treatment plants. Cost-efficient and simple field measurements such as photographs and probe readings could be proxies for process control parameters that normally require laboratory analysis. To investigate this, we evaluated questionnaire data, expert assessments, and simple analytical measurements for fecal sludge collected from 421 onsite containments. This data served as inputs to models of varying complexity. Random forest and linear regression models were able to predict physical-chemical characteristics including total solids (TS) and ammonium (NH4+-N) concentrations, and solid-liquid separation performance including settling efficiency and filtration time (R2 from 0.51-0.66) based on image analysis of photographs (sludge color, supernatant color, and texture) and probe readings (conductivity (EC) and pH). Supernatant color was the best predictor of settling efficiency and filtration time, EC was the best predictor of NH4+-N, and texture was the best predictor of TS. Predictive models have the potential to be applied for real-time monitoring and process control if a database of measurements is developed and models are validated in other cities. Simple decision tree models based on the single classifier of containment type can also be used to make predictions about citywide planning, where a lower degree of accuracy is required. © 2021 The Authors","fecal sludge; image analysis; machine learning; Random forest; sanitation; WASH","Chemical analysis; Classification (of information); Color; Data mining; Decision trees; Efficiency; Filtration; Image analysis; Learning systems; Photography; Probes; Regression analysis; Sanitation; Faecal sludge; Field measurement; Image-analysis; Machine-learning; Predictive models; Random forests; Simple++; Total solids; Treatment plants; WASH; Process control; organic matter; accuracy assessment; ammonium compound; concentration (composition); detection method; field method; filtration; image analysis; measurement method; physicochemical property; sludge; urban planning; waste management; Article; bacterial metabolism; chemical composition; chemical oxygen demand; color; filtration; human; image analysis; nutrient concentration; pH; priority journal; process control; sludge dewatering; sludge management; sludge stabilization; turbidity; waste water management; city; feces; filtration; sewage; Cities; Feces; Filtration; Sewage; Waste Disposal, Fluid",,"Sewage",,,"Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich, ETH; Direktion für Entwicklung und Zusammenarbeit, DEZA; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF; Eidgenössische Anstalt für Wasserversorgung Abwasserreinigung und Gewässerschutz, EAWAG","Samples and questionnaire data were collected as part of the “Faecal sludge quantities and qualities (Q&Q) in Lusaka” project, supported by the German Corporation for International Cooperation GmbH (GIZ).

However, studies have indicated that E. coli testing can present an economic burden to growers and that time lags between sampling and obtaining results may reduce the utility of these data. Models that predict E. coli levels in agricultural water may provide a mechanism for overcoming these obstacles. Thus, this proof-of-concept study uses previously published datasets to train, test, and compare E. coli predictive models using multiple algorithms and performance measures. Since the collection of different feature data carries specific costs for growers, predictive performance was compared for models built using different feature types [geospatial, water quality, stream traits, and/or weather features]. Model performance was assessed against baseline regression models. Model performance varied considerably with root-mean-squared errors and Kendall’s Tau ranging between 0.37 and 1.03, and 0.07 and 0.55, respectively. Overall, models that included turbidity, rain, and temperature outperformed all other models regardless of the algorithm used. Turbidity and weather factors were also found to drive model accuracy even when other feature types were included in the model. These findings confirm previous conclusions that machine learning models may be useful for predicting when, where, and at what level E. coli (and associated hazards) are likely to be present in preharvest agricultural water sources. This study also identifies specific algorithm-predictor combinations that should be the foci of future efforts to develop deployable models (i.e., models that can be used to guide on-farm decision-making and risk mitigation). When deploying E. coli predictive models in the field, it is important to note that past research indicates an inconsistent relationship between E. coli levels and foodborne pathogen presence. Thus, models that predict E. coli levels in agricultural water may be useful for assessing fecal contamination status and ensuring compliance with regulations but should not be used to assess the risk that specific pathogens of concern (e.g., Salmonella, Listeria) are present. © Copyright © 2021 Weller, Love and Wiedmann.","E. coli; food safety; machine learning; predictive model; water quality",,,,,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH: T32ES007271; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS; Center for Produce Safety, CPS: 2017CPS09","This project was funded by grants from the Center for Produce Safety under award number 2017CPS09 and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under award number T32ES007271.

The estimation of water turbidity is therefore significant for studies of coastal dynamics. Many factors influence turbidity in complex and nonlinear ways, making accurate estimations of turbidity a challenging task. In this study, three machine learning models, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Genetic Programming (GP), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are developed for better estimation and prediction of the tidally-averaged sea surface turbidity. The observational data of tides and waves at a macro-tidal coastal bay, Jiangsu coast, China are used as model inputs. Through data reduction, it is found that tidal average sea surface turbidity is most determined by the average tidal range of the two preceding tidal cycles (2 and 3 tidal periods before the present one, respectively) and the tidal average significant wave height of the present tidal cycle of turbidity. These three machine learning models all show successful estimations of turbidity, and comparisons of the optimized models indicate that ANN shows the best performance and GP helps to provide physically meaningful predictors. This study provides an example of developing a predictive machine learning algorithm with a limited dataset (94 tidal cycles). The generality of the present predictors can be reinforced with much more data from a variety of coastal environments. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial neural network; Genetic programming; Macro-tidal coastal bay; Support vector machine; Water turbidity","algorithm; ecosystem health; machine learning; prediction; sea surface; significant wave height; tidal cycle; tidal range; turbidity; China; Jiangsu",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 41676077, 41676081, 41976156, 51620105005","This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 41676077 , 41676081 , 41976156 , and 51620105005 ).

The monitoring of surface water quality by remote sensing monitoring technology can provide important research significance for water resources protection and water quality evaluation. Finding the optimal spectral index sensitive to water quality for remote sensing monitoring of water quality is extremely important for surface water quality analysis and treatment in the Ebinur Lake Basin in arid areas. This study used Sentinel-2MSI data at 10 m resolution to quickly monitor the water quality of the watershed. Through laboratory experiments and measurement data from the Ebinur Lake Basin, 22 water quality parameters (WQPs) were obtained. Through Z-score and redundancy analysis, 9 WQPs with significant contributions were extracted. Based on the remote sensing spectral band, four water indexes (NDWI, NWI, EWI, AWEI-nsh) and 2D modeling spectral index (DI, RI, NDI), the correlation analysis between WQPs and two kinds of spectral band indexes is carried out, and it is concluded that the overall correlation between WQP and 2D spectral modeling is more relevant. This paper calculates the evaluation and models the 2D spectrum of the Water Quality Index (WQI). The WQI is predicted and modeled through four machine learning algorithms (RF, SVM, PLSR, PLSR-SVM).The results show that the inversion effect of the two-dimensional spectral modeling index on water quality parameters (WQPs) is superior to that of the water index, and the correlation coefficient of the DI (R12-R1) SWIR-2 and BLUE band interpolation index reaches 0.787. On this basis, three kinds of two-dimensional spectral modeling indexes are used to inversely synthesize the WQI, and the correlation coefficient of the ratio index of the RI (R11/R8) SWIR-1 and near-infrared (NIR) bands is preferably 0.69. In the WQI prediction, the partial least squares regression support vector machine (PLSR-SVM) model in machine learning algorithms has good modeling and prediction effects (R2c ¼ 0.873, R2v ¼ 0.87), which can provide a good basis. The research results provide references for remote monitoring of surface water in arid areas, and provide a basis for water quality prediction and safety evaluation. © 2021 The Authors","Remote sensing reflectance; Sentinel-2 MSI; Water quality index (WQI); Water quality parameter (WQP); | machine learning","Arid regions; Forecasting; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Lakes; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Least squares approximations; Parameter estimation; Remote sensing; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Surface water resources; Water quality; Water treatment; Machine learning methods; Modeling and predictions; Partial least squares regression; Remote sensing monitoring; Water quality evaluation; Water quality parameters; Water quality predictions; Water resources protections; Quality control; ammonia; chloride; chromium; cobalt; copper; dissolved organic matter; dissolved oxygen; iron; nitrogen; phenol; phosphate; phosphorus; sodium chloride; sulfide; surface water; zinc; algorithm; identification method; interpolation; machine learning; pollution monitoring; remote sensing; satellite data; Sentinel; spectral resolution; water quality; water resource; watershed; Article; biochemical oxygen demand; calibration; chemical oxygen demand; controlled study; decision tree; environmental protection; evapotranspiration; human; lake basin; machine learning; nonpoint source pollution; partial least squares regression; prediction; random forest; remote sensing; support vector machine; suspended particulate matter; turbidity; water analysis; water hardness; water monitoring; water quality; water sampling; water supply; watershed; China; Ebinur Lake; Xinjiang Uygur; Varanidae",,"ammonia, 14798-03-9, 51847-23-5, 7664-41-7; chloride, 16887-00-6; chromium, 16065-83-1, 7440-47-3, 14092-98-9; cobalt, 7440-48-4; copper, 15158-11-9, 7440-50-8; iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; phenol, 108-95-2, 3229-70-7; phosphate, 14066-19-4, 14265-44-2; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; sodium chloride, 7647-14-5, 23724-87-0, 49658-21-1; sulfide, 18496-25-8; zinc, 7440-66-6, 14378-32-6",,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 41561089, 41771470, 41961059","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41771470), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41961059), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41561089).

To test this hypothesis, the study first examines a proof of concept by correlating between MPS's signals and high algae concentrations in an algal cultivation pond. Then, the study expanded upon these findings and examined if multiple water quality parameters could be predicted in real surface waters, like irrigation canals. Signals generated between the MPS sensors and other water quality sensors maintained by an Arizona utility company, including algae and chlorophyll, were collected in real time at time intervals of 30 min over a period of 9 months. Data from the MPS system and data collected by the utility company were used to train the ML/AI algorithms and compare the predicted with actual water quality parameters and algae concentrations. Based on the composite signal obtained from the MPS, the ML/AI was used to predict the canal surface water's turbidity, conductivity, chlorophyll, and blue-green algae (BGA), dissolved oxygen (DO), and pH, and predicted values were compared to the measured values. Initial testing in the algal cultivation pond revealed a strong linear correlation (R2 = 0.87) between mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) and the MPSs' composite signals. The Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) between the predicted values and measured values were &lt;6.5%, except for the DO, which was 10.45%. The results demonstrate the usefulness of MPSs to predict key surface water quality parameters through a single composite signal, when the ML/AI tools are used conjunctively to disaggregate these signal components. The maintenance-free MPS offers a novel and cost-effective approach to monitor numerous water quality parameters at once with relatively high accuracy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Algae; Artificial intelligence; Machine learning; Microbial potentiometric sensor; Monitoring; Water quality","Algae; Chlorophyll; Cost effectiveness; Dissolved oxygen; Forecasting; Hydraulic structures; Irrigation canals; Lakes; Machine learning; Mean square error; Potentiometers (electric measuring instruments); Potentiometric sensors; Predictive analytics; Water quality; Algal cultivations; Cost-effective approach; Linear correlation; Mixed liquor suspended solids; Real time monitoring; Root mean square errors; Water quality parameters; Water quality sensors; Biochemical oxygen demand; chlorophyll; dissolved oxygen; surface water; chlorophyll; concentration (composition); conductivity; cyanobacterium; dissolved oxygen; environmental monitoring; machine learning; pH; prediction; real time; sensor; surface water; turbidity; water quality; accuracy; alga; algal bloom; Article; biological monitoring; concentration (parameter); conductance; controlled study; cyanobacterium; environmental monitoring; equipment design; eutrophication; machine learning; nonhuman; pH; prediction; predictive value; priority journal; signal processing; turbidity; water quality; Arizona; artificial intelligence; machine learning; Cyanobacteria; Varanidae; Arizona; Artificial Intelligence; Environmental Monitoring; Machine Learning; Water Quality",,"chlorophyll, 1406-65-1, 15611-43-5",,,"U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC; Biological and Environmental Research, BER: DE-SC0013194","The study is partially funded by Salt River Project (SRP) under ASU/SRP Joint Research Program .

The samples were collected from Korattur Lake in Chennai city and tested for its necessary hydro-chemical parameters. The machine learning models such as support vector machine, decision tree, logistic regression, random forest, and naive Bayesian for assessing the water quality with respect to the accuracy and precision of the model. The water quality parameters such as pH, total dissolved salts, turbidity, phosphate, nitrate, iron, chemical oxygen demand, chloride, and sodium are used as a raw dataset. The models are then tested and evaluated to find the best suitable model by comparing and analyzing the accuracy of prediction, the precision rate, and the time taken for execution of all the models. Among all the algorithms employed, the random forest algorithm produces 95% accuracy which is the highest and also con-sumes the least execution time. From the random forest model, it was found that water quality has 84% of contamination which was attributed to unfit for drinking purpose. Hence, it could be sug-gested that water quality left disturbed due to anthropogenic activities and improper maintenance. © 2021 Desalination Publications.

Many water quality monitoring programs sample too infrequently (i.e., weekly or monthly) to fully characterize lotic nutrient conditions and to accurately estimate nutrient loadings. A popular solution to this problem is the surrogate-regression approach, a method by which nutrient concentrations are estimated from related parameters (e.g., conductivity or turbidity) that can easily be measured in situ at high frequency using sensors. However, stream water quality data often exhibit skewed distributions, nonlinear relationships, and multicollinearity, all of which can be problematic for linear-regression models. Here, we use a flexible and robust machine learning technique, Random Forests Regression (RFR), to estimate stream nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations from sensor data within a forested, mountainous drainage area in upstate New York. When compared to actual nutrient data from samples tested in the laboratory, this approach explained much of the variation in nitrate (89%), total N (85%), particulate P (76%), and total P (74%). The models were less accurate for total soluble P (47%) and soluble reactive P (32%), though concentrations of these latter parameters were in a relatively low range. Although soil moisture and fluorescent dissolved organic matter are not commonly used as surrogates in nutrient-regression models, they were important predictors in this study. We conclude that RFR shows great promise as a tool for modeling instantaneous stream nutrient concentrations from high-frequency sensor data, and encourage others to evaluate this approach for supplementing traditional (laboratory-determined) nutrient datasets. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Machine learning; Nutrients; Random forests; Regression; Stream chemistry; Surrogate","Decision trees; Eutrophication; Learning systems; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Random forests; Regression analysis; Soil moisture; Water quality; Dissolved organic matters; High frequency sensors; Linear regression models; Machine learning techniques; Nitrogen and phosphorus; Non-linear relationships; Nutrient concentrations; Water quality monitoring; Data streams; dissolved organic matter; nitrate; nitrogen; phosphorus; algorithm; concentration (composition); machine learning; nitrogen; nutrient; phosphorus; prediction; regression analysis; sensor; stream; water chemistry; Article; catchment area (hydrology); concentration (parameter); fluorescence analysis; machine learning; measurement accuracy; New York; nutrient concentration; prediction; priority journal; random forest; random forests regression; soil moisture; stream (river); New York [United States]; United States",,"nitrate, 14797-55-8; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; phosphorus, 7723-14-0",,,"1625044; 7290; International Business Machines Corporation, IBM; Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, RPI","We gratefully acknowledge assistance by personnel associated with the Jefferson Project at Lake George, a collaboration between Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, IBM Research, and the FUND for Lake George.

The study was conducted over the course of two years to establish seasonal base-line biomass productivity and composition for bioproducts applications, and to identify key environmental factors and flow-way cohorts impacting biomass production. For the entire cultivation period, continuous ash-free biomass production at 4 to 10 g/m2/day (corresponding to nutrient recovery at 300 to 500 mg of nitrogen/m2/day and 15 to 30 mg of phosphorus/m2/day) was successfully achieved without system restart. Upon start-up, a latency period was observed which indicates roles for species succession from relatively low productivity, high ash content pioneer periphytic culture composed primarily of benthic diatoms from the source waters to higher productivity, reduced ash content, and more resilient culture mainly composed of filamentous chlorophyta, Ulva lactuca. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to identify environmental factors driving biomass production, and machine learning (ML) models were constructed to assess the predictive capability of the data set for system performance using the local multi-season environmental variations. Environmental datasets were segregated for ML training, validation, and testing using three methods: regression tree, ensemble regression, and Gaussian process regression (GPR). The predicted ash-free biomass productivity using ML models resulted in root-squared-mean-errors (RSME) from 1.78 to 1.86 g/m2/day, and R2 values from 0.67 to 0.75 using different methods. The greatest contributor to net productivity was total solar irradiation, followed by air temperature, salinity, and pH. The results of the study should be useful as a decision-making tool to application of attached algae flow-ways for biomass production while preventing algal blooms in the environment. © 2021","Algal turf scrubber; Attached algae flow-way; Long-term biomass production; Machine learning; Nutrient recovery; Principal component analysis","Algae; Biomass; Cultivation; Decision making; Machine learning; Nutrients; Productivity; Regression analysis; Surface discharges; Surface waters; Algal turf scrubber; Attached alga flow-way; Attached algae; Biomass productions; Biomass productivity; Long-term biomass production; Machine-learning; Nonpoint sources; Nutrient recovery; Principal-component analysis; Principal component analysis; carbon dioxide; dissolved oxygen; nitrogen; phosphorus; nitrogen; phosphorus; alga; biomass; cultivation; data set; environmental factor; error analysis; machine learning; performance assessment; regression analysis; succession; air temperature; alga; ambient air; Article; biomass production; cohort analysis; cross validation; diatom; environmental factor; eutrophication; latent period; machine learning; nonhuman; nutrient; pH; photoautotroph; priority journal; salinity; seasonal variation; solar radiation; spring; summer; turbidity; Ulva intestinalis; Ulva lactuca; water quality; winter; biomass; Texas; Corpus Christi; Laguna Madre [Texas]; Texas; United States; Bacillariophyta; Chlorophyta; Laguna; Ulva lactuca; Biomass; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Texas",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; Nitrogen; Phosphorus",,,"U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, EERE; Bioenergy Technologies Office, BETO: 27375","This work was supported by the US Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) , BioEnergy Technologies Office (BETO) , Advanced Algae Systems program under agreement 27375.

WQ degradation is mostly a result of the increase of the concentration of chlorophyll-a in a waterbody, however, proper estimation of daily chlorophyll-a concentration is a complex problem. In this study, the classic extreme learning machine (ELM), group method of data handling (GMDH), random forest (RF), classification and regression tree (CART), and a novel integrated Bat-ELM model (with the bat optimization algorithm) were developed and applied to predict daily chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration in river and lake ecosystems. Input parameters including turbidity (TU), pH, specific conductance (SC), water temperature (TE), and periodicity were applied as the influential elements for estimating daily Chl-a concentration for two different USGS stations. General results based on RMSE values indicated that the Bat-ELM as the most robust model improved the performance of standard ELM, GMDH, RF, and CART models during the testing procedure by 20.7%, 23.9%, 18.3%, and 27.4% in USGS no. 05543010 and 13.8%, 16.8%, 17.5%, and 52.0% in USGS no. 09014050 in terms of the 7th input-combination, respectively. Moreover, the results revealed that periodicity is the most effective input parameter that considered as the last scenario (input combination) on daily chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Bat-ELM; Chlorophyll-a concentration; Water quality","Aquatic ecosystems; Chlorophyll; Data handling; Decision trees; Knowledge acquisition; Lakes; Learning algorithms; Water quality; Chlorophyll-a concentration; Classification and regression tree; Environmental Monitoring; Extreme learning machine; Group method of data handling; Optimization algorithms; Specific conductance; Water temperatures; Machine learning",,,,,"U.S. Geological Survey, USGS","The authors are grateful for the reviewers of this paper and the USGS for providing the data used in this study.",,,,,,,,,,"Alitaleshi, F., Daghbandan, A., Using a multi-objective optimal design of GMDH type neural networks to evaluate the quality of treated water in a water treatment plant (2019) DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT, 139, pp. 123-132; Alizamir, M., Kisi, O., Modelling long-term groundwater fluctuations by extreme learning machine using hydro-climatic data (2018) Hydrol.

However, understanding and predicting disinfection by-product formation under a variety of conditions in drinking water distribution systems remains challenging as disinfection by-product formation is a multifactorial phenomenon. This study aimed to assess the application of Bayesian Network models to predict the concentration of trihalomethanes, the dominant halogenated disinfection by-product class, using various water quality parameters. Naïve Bayesian and semi-naïve Bayesian models were constructed from Sydney and South East Queensland datasets across 15 drinking water distribution systems in Australia. The targeted variable, total trihalomethanes concentration, was discretised into 3 bins (&lt;0.1 mg L−1, 0.1 – 0.2 mg L−1 and &gt;0.2 mg L−1). The Bayesian network structures were built using water quality parameters including concentrations of individual and total trihalomethanes, disinfectant species (free chlorine, monochloramine, dichloramine, total chlorine), nitrogen species (free ammonia, total ammonia, nitrate, nitrite), and other physical/chemical parameters (temperature, pH, dissolved organic carbon, total dissolved solids, conductivity and turbidity). Seven performance parameters, including predictive accuracy and the rates of true and false positive and negative results, were used to assess the accuracy and precision of the Bayesian network models. After evaluating the model performance, the optimum models were selected to be Bayesian network augmented naïve models. These were observed to have the highest predictive accuracies for Sydney (78%) and South East Queensland (94%). Although disinfectant residuals are among the key variables that lead to trihalomethanes formation, potential concentrations of trihalomethanes in distribution systems can be more confidently predicted, in terms of probability associated with a wider range of water quality variables, using Bayesian networks. The modelling procedure developed in this work can now be applied to develop system-specific Bayesian network models for trihalomethanes prediction in other drinking water distribution systems. © 2020","Bayesian network; chloramination; Disinfection by-products (DBPs); Drinking water distribution system; Trihalomethanes (THMs)","Amination; Ammonia; Chlorine; Disinfectants; Disinfection; Forecasting; Organic carbon; Potable water; Probability distributions; Quality control; Structures (built objects); Water distribution systems; Water quality; Application of Bayesian networks; Bayesian network structure; Disinfection by product formations; Disinfection by-products formations; Dissolved organic carbon; Drinking water disinfection; Trihalomethanes formations; Water quality parameters; Bayesian networks; ammonia; bromide; bromide ion; bromodichloromethane; bromoform; chlorine; chloroform; dibromochloromethane; drinking water; monochloramine; nitrate; nitrite; organic carbon; trihalomethane; disinfectant agent; drinking water; trihalomethane; byproduct; drinking water; multivariate analysis; network analysis; water quality; accuracy; Article; Bayesian network; conductance; controlled study; disinfection; false positive result; halogenation; limit of detection; machine learning; nitrification; pH; physical chemistry; prediction; priority journal; reverse osmosis; sensitivity analysis; turbidity; water quality; water supply; water temperature; Australia; Bayes theorem; Queensland; water management; water pollutant; water quality; Australia; New South Wales; Queensland; Sydney [New South Wales]; Australia; Bayes Theorem; Chlorine; Disinfectants; Disinfection; Drinking Water; Halogenation; Queensland; Trihalomethanes; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification; Water Quality",,"ammonia, 14798-03-9, 51847-23-5, 7664-41-7; bromide, 24959-67-9; bromodichloromethane, 75-27-4; bromoform, 75-25-2; chlorine, 13981-72-1, 7782-50-5; chloroform, 67-66-3; dibromochloromethane, 124-48-1; monochloramine, 10599-90-3; nitrate, 14797-55-8; nitrite, 14797-65-0; Chlorine; Disinfectants; Drinking Water; Trihalomethanes; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,"Australian Research Council, ARC: LP1601009099","This research was funded by the Australian Research Council (ARC LP1601009099).

This study introduces a new ensemble machine learning model called Extra Tree Regression (ETR) for predicting monthly WQI values at the Lam Tsuen River in Hong Kong. The ETR model performance is compared with that of the classic standalone models, Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Decision Tree Regression (DTR). The monthly input water quality data including Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Electrical Conductivity (EC), Nitrate-Nitrogen (NO3 -N), Nitrite-Nitrogen (NO2 -N), Phosphate (PO43-), potential for Hydrogen (pH), Temperature (T) and Turbidity (TUR) are used for building the prediction models. Various input data combinations are investigated and assessed in terms of prediction performance, using numerical indices and graphical comparisons. The analysis shows that the ETR model generally produces more accurate WQI predictions for both training and testing phases. Although including all the ten input variables achieves the highest prediction performance (R2test=0.98, RMSEtest=2.99), a combination of input parameters including only BOD, Turbidity and Phosphate concentration provides the second highest prediction accuracy (R2test=0.97, RMSEtest=3.74). The uncertainty analysis relative to model structure and input parameters highlights a higher sensitivity of the prediction results to the former. In general, the ETR model represents an improvement on previous approaches for WQI prediction, in terms of prediction performance and reduction in the number of input parameters. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.","Ensemble machine learning; Lam Tsuen river; River water quality; Water quality index","Biochemical oxygen demand; Decision trees; Dissolved oxygen; Forecasting; Machine learning; Quality control; Support vector regression; Surface waters; Turbidity; Uncertainty analysis; Water quality; Biochemical oxygen demands (BOD); Decision tree regression; Electrical conductivity; Machine learning models; Phosphate concentration; Prediction performance; Support vector regression (SVR); Water quality indexes; Predictive analytics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Grabowski, R.C., Gurnell, A.M., Hydrogeomorphology - ecology interactions in river systems (2016) River Res.

Henceforth, having a reliable tool for predicting turbidity values based on common water quantity/quality measured parameters is of great importance. In the present paper, the performance of the online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) in predicting daily values of turbidity in Brandywine Creek, Pennsylvania, is evaluated. For this purpose, in addition to the developed OS-ELM, several data-driven models, that is, multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPANN), the classification and regression tree (CART), the group method of data handling (GMDH) and the response surface method (RSM) have been applied. The general findings of the study confirm the superiority of the OS-ELM model over the other applied models so that the OS-ELM improved the averaged RMSE of the predicted values 9.1, 11.7, 20.5 and 29.3% over the MLPANN, GMDH, RSM and CART models, respectively. © 2020 CIWEM","aquatic systems; data mining; environmental engineering; OSELM; soft computing","Data handling; E-learning; Forecasting; Knowledge acquisition; Machine learning; Multilayer neural networks; Potable water; River pollution; Trees (mathematics); Turbidity; Water quality; Water resources; Classification and regression tree; Comparative studies; Group method of data handling; Measured parameters; Multi-layer perceptron neural networks; Online sequential extreme learning machine; Response surface method; River water quality; Data mining; dissolved oxygen; river water; comparative study; data mining; machine learning; performance assessment; prediction; river water; turbidity; water pollution; water quality; accuracy; algorithm; Article; artificial neural network; comparative study; conductance; data mining; decision tree; feed forward neural network; information processing; machine learning; multilayer perceptron; online system; Pennsylvania; priority journal; response surface method; sequence learning; turbidity; water flow; water quality; water supply; water temperature; Pennsylvania; United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adamowski, J., Sun, K., Development of a coupled wavelet transform and neural network method for flow forecasting of non-perennial rivers in semi-arid watersheds (2010) Journal of Hydrology, 390 (1-2), pp. 85-91; Adnan, R.M., Liang, Z., El-Shafie, A., Zounemat-Kermani, M., Kisi, O., Prediction of suspended sediment load using data-driven models (2019) Water, 11 (10), p. 2060; Adnan, R.M., Liang, Z., Heddam, S., Zounemat-Kermani, M., Kisi, O., Li, B., Least square support vector machine and multivariate adaptive regression splines for streamflow prediction in mountainous basin using hydro-meteorological data as inputs (2020) Journal of Hydrology, 586, p. 124371; Adnan, R.M., Liang, Z., Trajkovic, S., Zounemat-Kermani, M., Li, B., Kisi, O., Daily streamflow prediction using optimally pruned extreme learning machine (2019) Journal of Hydrology, 577, p. 123981; Alizamir, M., Kisi, O., Zounemat-Kermani, M., Modeling long-term groundwater fluctuations by extreme learning machine using hydro-climatic data (2018) Hydrological Sciences Journal, 63 (1), pp. 63-73; Beaudeau, P., Leboulanger, T., Lacroix, M., Hanneton, S., Wang, H., Forecasting of turbid floods in a coastal, chalk karstic drain using an artificial neural network (2001) Groundwater, 39 (1), pp. 109-118; Breiman, L., Friedman, J.H., Olshen, R.A., Stone, C.J., Classification and regression trees.

Their ease of use, ability to carry sensors, low cost, precise manoeuvrability, and navigation makes them versatile tools. The goal of this study is to investigate if sUAS multispectral imagery can be utilized to measure turbidity and total suspended solids (TSS) of small streams. sUAS multispectral imagery and water samples at varying depths were collected before and after rain events on three sampling dates in 2019 from Moores Creek in Lanett, Alabama (AL), United States of America (USA), which was restored in 2017. The water samples were processed for TSS and turbidity and related to pixel values from the multispectral imagery. Linear regression was used to develop models for TSS and turbidity. The models were then tested on Moores Mill Creek in Chewacla State Park, AL, USA. For Lanett, TSS and turbidity regression models for low flows had coefficients of determination (R 2) values of 0.77 and 0.78, respectively. During high flows, different single bands and band ratios were required for comparable R 2 values, suggesting separate models may be needed for high and low flow events. When the Lanett models were applied to Chewacla State Park, predicted TSS and turbidity were not comparable to measured values indicating that location-specific models may be required. Future research should incorporate depth as a variable since streambed visibility likely impacts results, along with other modelling and data analysis methods, such as machine learning. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,"Antennas; Regression analysis; Turbidity; Data analysis methods; Field data collection; Measured values; Multi-spectral imagery; Regression model; Total suspended solids; Turbidity monitoring; United States of America; Remote sensing; environmental monitoring; imagery; pixel; regression analysis; remote sensing; stream; turbidity; water quality; Alabama; United States; Alabama",,,,,"Auburn University, AU","This work was supported by the Auburn University Office of Undergraduate Research; Virginia Tech Interdisciplinary Graduate Education Program in Remote Sensing; Auburn University Samuel Ginn College of Engineering 100+ Women Strong.

Water quality standards are developed based on logical evidence on the effects of hazardous compounds on a certain quantity of water used. Classification technique of machine learning can be employed to under-stand the water quality status. In this work, supervised machine learning models are being implemented to classify water quality indexes, and the Smote analysis is used to handle the imbalance in the dataset. Artificial neural net-work model is built using the features such as Oxygen, pH, temperature, total suspended sediment, turbidity, nitrogen, and phosphorus as inputs and water quality check as target variable. This target variable is created using Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment Water Quality Index, and the model works with an accuracy of 87%. The classification is done on XGBoost model as well and it performs with an accuracy of 90%. The explanations for predictions of these models for a data instance were performed using explainable artificial intelligence tools such as LIME and SHAP. The results and interpretations for the predictions seem to be more promising and attractive making the proposed models more interpretable, accurate and efficient. Through our re-search we can benefit our readers by providing them clarity about exactly what features are having more influence on water quality than others from different machine learning algorithms. This will help the developers to gain insights about the significant factors of poor water quality and how to overcome that. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.","Artificial neural network; Explainable AI; gradient boosting; Lime; multi-label classification; SHAP; Super-vised machine learning","Classification (of information); Lime; Neural networks; Supervised learning; Suspended sediments; Explainable AI; Gradient boosting; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Multi-label classifications; SHAP; Super-vised machine learning; Supervised machine learning; Water quality indexes; Water quality standard; Water quality",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2007) National Water Quality Monitoring Programme, Fifth Monitoring Report (2005–2006), , Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources Islamabad: Islamabad, Pakistan; Solanki, A., Agrawal, H., Khare, K., Predictive analysis of water quality parameters using deep learning (2015) International Journal of Computers and Applications, 125 (9), pp. 29-34; Liu, P., Wang, J., Sangaiah, A.K., Xie, Y., Yin, X, Analysis and Prediction of Water Quality Using LSTM Deep Neural Networks in IoT Environment (2019) Sustainability, 11, p. 2058; Barzegar, R., Aalami, M.T., Adamowski, J., Short-term water quality variable prediction using a hybrid CNN–LSTM deep learning model (2020) Stoch Environ Res Risk Assess, 34, pp. 415-433; Ahmed, U., Mumtaz, R., Anwar, H., Shah, A.A., Irfan, R., García-Nieto, J., Efficient Water Quality Prediction Using Supervised Machine Learning (2019) Water, 11, p. 2210; Maxwell, Andrew, Li, Runzhi, Yang, Bei, Weng, Heng, Ou, A., Hong, H., Zhou, Zhaoxian, Zhang, C., Deep learning architectures for multi-label classification of intelligent health risk prediction (2017) BMC Bioinformatics, 18. , pag; Opitz, David, Maclin, Richard, Popular Ensemble Methods: An Empirical Study (1999) Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, pp. 169-198; Suleman, M.

Water quality is a critical factor in cultivating aquaculture. The profitability of aquaculture was influenced by various regular water parameters like PH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, carbonates, nitrates, ammonia, etc. The sustainability and profitability of aquaculture were developed by implementing emerging technologies. The proposed framework, implemented using Arduino and Machine Learning. The Arduino Uno gathers information like PH, Temperature, Dissolved Oxygen, turbidity in water using sensors and parameters predicted in advance using machine learning techniques.

Fish is an amazing wellspring of protein that compares with meat even with minimal effort in production. The majority of consecutive fish farming and the subsisting intelligent system failed to produce anticipated amount of fish. The main aim of this research is to introduce an effective IoT-based low-cost fish farm which will also be high in the production of fish. A WEMOS D1 is actively involved in the determination of different basic water parameters such as temperature, oil layer, pH, water level, conductivity, oxygen level, turbidity, and fish behavior to anticipate their hunger status which significantly impacts on the quick fish growth. Via our built interactive smartphone application and Web interface, these pieces of information are transmitted to the end user. The D1 microcontroller works on the ESP8266 WIFI module through which the system sends the information to the mobile and web application. In the event of an abnormal situation, exceeding a predefined threshold value, the framework will inform the concerted authority to take immediate steps. In addition, the system is more remarkable and extraordinary as it can predict the amount of following day fish food and other constraints required for fish farmers to take a precautionary measure in advance. These characteristics would allow a fishery proprietor to grow a large number of fish via reducing the protein challenge. © The Author(s), 2021.","Oil layer detection; PH sensor; Random Forest Regression (RFR); Support Vector Regression (SVR)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2013), http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11822/8484, [Online].

Despite having the largest mangrove forest, Indonesia's mangrove annual damage rate turns out to be the highest globally, one of the most significant factors is extensive plastic waste exposure, exacerbated by mangroves' deforestation for conversion into agricultural land. Many efforts initiated by the government and other stakeholders have been targeting mangrove rehabilitation and plastic waste abatement. Labor-intensive and time-consuming ground checking have been the main source of information to determine priority areas for mangrove rehabilitation so far. This study aims to introduce a more effective and efficient identification of priority areas for rehabilitation. The study utilizes vulnerability index by optimizing remote sensing satellite data modeling. The study covers all mangroves in Indonesia, and for the purpose of this study, four mangrove vulnerability classes are formed to help categorize the severity of the damage. The classes are formed through integration, scoring, and classifying plant health, water turbidity, land temperature, plant carbon sequestration capability, and plastic waste distribution in Indonesian coastal area data. The modeling demonstrates its ability to distinguish the classes through machine learning. This study identifies that 65.74% of Indonesia's coastal mangroves are highly exposed to plastic waste. Bali and Surabaya are two of the most severely damaged areas. This study, along with further analysis of socio-cultural, economic, and development priorities, will enable decision-makers to prioritize and mobilize necessary resources to rehabilitate the mangroves guided by a suitable mangrove management regime for each class. © 2021 SPIE.","Anthropogenic; Global Warming; Mangrove; Plastic Waste","Carbon; Decision making; Deforestation; Remote sensing; Water quality; Anthropogenics; Forest area; Indonesia; Mangrove; Mangrove forest; Mangrove rehabilitations; Plastics waste; Remote sensing satellites; Satellite data; Water quality modelling; Global warming",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Delworth, T., Zeng, F., Vecchi, G., Yang, X., Zhang, L., Zhang, R., The North Atlantic Oscillation as a Driver of Rapid Climate Change in the Northern Hemisphere (2016) Nature Geoscience, 9, pp. 509-512. , [1]; (2020) World Research Institute, , https://www.wri.org/data/world-greenhouse-gas-emissions-2016, [2] World Research Institute, 3 February [online].

Checking the quality of water regularly can be an initial step in ensuring pure drinking water. The existing system is time consuming and monotonous manual system. Therefore, we propose a system based on Machine Learning (ML) and Internet of Things(IoT) that can measure and forecast future water quality parameters. For this, the daily water quality data was taken from the Muvattupuzha River in Kerala. Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM NN) was used to bring out the time series pattern in the data. The sensors like pH sensor, turbidity sensor and total dissolved solids (TDS) sensor were used to read the current water quality parameters and this data was used to predict the future parameter values. The IoT module which includes the sensors, Arduino and NodeMCU can be installed in the water source to monitor the parameters regularly.

The most method for determining the optimal coagulant dosage is the jar test, but this is clearly laborious and time-consuming task. Widely used regression models such as multiple linear regression (MLR) are unable to provide a high linking between water quality variables and the optimal coagulant dosage, due to the high nonlinearity and the multiple factors affecting the coagulation process. In this chapter, we propose a new robust method for predicting coagulant dosage using machine learning approaches. We proposed and compared two methods, namely, extremely randomized tree (ERT) and random forest (RF) models. To demonstrate the usefulness and robustness of the proposed models, a result using the MLR models was also provided for further comparison. The models were developed using several water quality variables selected as input of the models, namely, turbidity, pH, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, and the water temperature. The accuracy of the models was evaluated using coefficient of correlation (R), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), root-mean-square error, and mean absolute error. According to the obtained results, the ERT approach was robust across methods tested. Both ERT and RF provided high accuracy during the training and validation phases; however, standard MLR model showed a lowest accuracy both in training and validation phases and the coagulant dosage was often incorrectly predicted. During the validation phase, the R and NSE values of the ERT model were the greatest with values equal to 0.899 and 0.790, respectively, greater than the values provided by the RF model (R=0.851, NSE=0.708), and significantly higher than the values provided by the MLR model, indicating that the ERT was the best and supporting the use of this model for predicting coagulant dosage in drinking water treatment plant. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

This study aimed at applying a machine learning-based approach integrating attribute-realization (AR) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to classify the Chao Phraya River’s water quality. The historical monitoring dataset during 2008–2019 including biological oxygen demand (BOD), conductivity (Cond), dissolved oxygen (DO), faecal coliform bacteria (FCB), total coliform bacteria (TCB), ammonia (NH3-N), nitrate (NO3-N), salinity (Sal), suspended solids (SS), total nitrogen (TN), total dissolved solids (TDS), and turbidity (Turb), were processed via four studied steps: data pre-processing by means substituting method, contributing parameter evaluation by recognition pattern study, examination of the mathematic functions for quality classification, and validation of obtained approach. The results showed that NH3-N, TCB, FCB, BOD, DO, and Sal were the main attributes contributing orderly to water quality classification with confidence values of 0.80, 0.79, 0.78, 0.76, 0.69, and 0.64, respectively. Linear regression was the most suitable function to river water data classification than Sigmoid, Radial basis and Polynomial. The different number of attributes and mathematic functions promoted the different classification performance and accuracy. The validation confirmed that AR-SVM was a potent approach application to classify river water’s quality with 0.86–0.95 accuracy when applied three to six attributes. © 2021.

Water turbidity is a reliable and direct indicator that can reflect the water quality. Remote sensing has become an efficient technology for monitoring large-scale water turbidity. This study aims to search an optimal regression model to accurately predict water turbidity using remote sensing data. To achieve this goal, 187 water samples were collected from field campaigns across Northeast China, in 2018, of which the samples were gathered within ±6 days of Sentinel-2 overpasses. The spectral reflectance data was used as independent variables for modeling. The simple regression, partial least squares regression, support vector regression, extreme learning machine, back-propagation neural network, classification and regression tree, gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), random forest (RF), and K-nearest neighbor were used to compare. From model validation, we identified GBDT as the best regression model (R2 = 0.88, RMSE = 9.90 NTU, MAE = 6.71 NTU). We applied GBDT to retrieve the water turbidity and obtained a satisfactory result. Feature selection technique from tree-based ensemble method was also tested. We selected B2, B3, B4, and B5 as the important variables because of their high ability to explain the variation of turbidity. These results demonstrated the significance of using a promising method to retrieve water turbidity using Sentinel-2 imagery at the regional scale. It is beneficial to monitor the spatial-temporal distribution of water turbidity; support water quality management and inland water environment protection. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Machine learning algorithms; remote estimation; Sentinel-2; water turbidity","Backpropagation; Decision trees; Lakes; Least squares approximations; Nearest neighbor search; Quality management; Remote sensing; Reservoirs (water); Support vector regression; Turbidity; Water conservation; Water management; Water quality; Back propagation neural networks; Classification and regression tree; Extreme learning machine; K nearest neighbor (KNN); Monitoring water quality; Partial least squares regressions (PLSR); Spatial-temporal distribution; Support vector regression (SVR); Learning systems; algorithm; lake; machine learning; remote sensing; Sentinel; spatial distribution; temporal distribution; turbidity; water management; water quality; China; Indicator indicator; Varanidae",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 40170304; Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC: 2016YFB0501502, 2019YFC0409105","Manuscript received February 10, 2021; revised July 1, 2021 and August 15, 2021; accepted August 21, 2021.

However, pollution of water has become a global problem. 2.4 billion people worldwide live without any form of water sanitation. This work focuses on case study of water pollution in Pakistan where only 20% of the population has an access to good-quality water. Drinking bad-quality water causes diseases such as hepatitis, diarrhea and typhoid. Moreover, people living close to the industrial areas are more prone to drinking polluted water and catching diseases as a result. Yet, there is no system that can monitor the quality of water or help in disease prevention. In this work, an Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled water quality monitoring system is developed that works as a stand-alone portable solution for monitoring water quality accurately and in real time. The real-time results are stored in a cloud database. The public web portal shows these results in the form of data sheets, maps and charts for analyzing data. Further, this data along with the collected data of past water quality is used to generate machine learning (ML) models for prediction of water quality. As a consequence, a model for prediction of water quality is trained and tested on a test set. The predictions on the test set resulted in a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.264.

To determine WQI the groundwater samples were exposed to a detailed physico-chemical experimentation of seven parameters such as pH, Total Hardness, Total Alkalinity, Chlorides, Turbidity, Carbonates and Bicarbonates. The values of the examined samples were compared with the water quality requirements of the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). The result of the present study indicates that 84.4% of water samples fell in good quality and that only 15.6% of water samples fell under the poor water category exceeding the acceptable and permissible limits of BIS approved drinking water quality standards (Indian Standard Drinking Water IS:10500–2012). This determined the WQI index for the same and the values ranged from 47.12 to 192.104. Along with that machine learning techniques helped us understand the relation between pH and WQI index, where pH fluctuation is compared to water quality. The study shows that treatment is needed in the region’s groundwater before it is used for drinking and other uses. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","GIS; Noida; Physico-chemical analysis; Water quality index (WQI)","Alkalinity; Chlorine compounds; Geographic information systems; Groundwater; Machine learning; Water quality; Indian standards; Machine learning techniques; pH fluctuations; Physico-chemicals; Total alkalinities; Total hardness; Water quality indexes; Water samples; Potable water",,,,,,"Funding The authors thank Dr. A.P.J AKTU, Lucknow, for providing financial assistance through Collaborative Research and Innovation Program (CRIP).",,,,,,,,,,"Adimalla, N., Li, P., Venkatayogi, S., Hydrogeochemical evaluation of groundwater quality for drinking and irrigation purposes and inte-grated interpretation with water quality index studies (2018) Environ Process, 5 (2), pp. 363-383; Bureau of Indian Standards (2012) New Delhi, pp. 2-3; Bashir, N., Saeed, R., Afzaal, M., Ahmad, A., Muhammad, N., Iqbal, J., Khan, A., Hameed, S., Water quality assessment of lower Jhelum canal in Pakistan by using geographic information system (GIS) (2020) Groundw Sustain Dev, 10; Batabyal, A.K., Chakraborty, S., Hydrogeochemistry and water quality index in the assessment of groundwater quality for drinking uses (2015) Res Water Environ Res, 87, pp. 607-617; Brindha, K., Elango, L., Groundwater quality zonation in a shallow weathered rock aquifer using GIS (2012) Geo-Spatial Inf Sci, 15, pp. 95-104; Brindha, K., Rajesh, R., Murugan, R., Elango, L., Fluoride contamination in groundwater in parts of Nalgonda District, Andhra Pradesh, India (2011) Environ Monit Assess, 172, pp. 481-492; Deepesh, M., Madan, K.J., Bimal, C.M., GIS-based assessment and characterization of groundwater quality in a hard-rock hilly terrain of Western India (2011) Environ Monit Assess, 174, pp. 645-663. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-010-1485-5; Karanth, K.R., (1987) Ground Water Assessment: Development and Management, , Tata McGraw-Hill Education; Magesh, N.S., Krishnakumar, S., Chandrasekar, N., Soundranayagam, J.P., Groundwater quality assessment using WQI and GIS tech-niques, Dindigul district, Tamil Nadu, India (2013) Arab J Geosci, 6, pp. 4179-4189; Munesh, K., Rai, S.C., Hydro geochemical evaluation of groundwater quality for drinking and irrigation purposes using water quality index in Semi-Arid Region of India (2020) J Geol Soc India, 95, pp. 159-168; Saleem M, Hussain and Gauhar Mahmood (2016) Analysis of groundwater quality using water quality index: a case study of greater Noida (Region), Uttar Pradesh (UP), India Civil & Environmental Engineering.

In this study, five different ensemble machine learning (ML) models including Quantile regression forest (QRF), Random Forest (RF), radial support vector machine (SVM), Stochastic Gradient Boosting (GBM) and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM_H2O) were developed to predict the monthly biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) values of the Euphrates River, Iraq. For this aim, monthly average data of water temperature (T), Turbidity, pH, Electrical Conductivity (EC), Alkalinity (Alk), Calcium (Ca), chemical oxygen demand (COD), Sulfate (SO4), total dissolved solids (TDS), total suspended solids (TSS), and BOD measured for ten years period were used in this study. The performances of these standalone models were compared with integrative models developed by coupling the applied ML models with two different feature extraction algorithms i.e., Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Principal Components Analysis (PCA). The reliability of the applied models was evaluated based on the statistical performance criteria of determination coefficient (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE), Willmott index (d), and percent bias (PBIAS). Results showed that among the developed models, QRF model attained the superior performance. The performance of the evaluated models presented in this study proved that the developed integrative PCA-QRF model presented much better performance compared with the standalone ones and with those integrated with GA. The statistical criteria of R2, RMSE, MAE, NSE, d, and PBIAS of PCA-QRF were 0.94, 0.12, 0.05, 0.93, 0.98, and 0.3, respectively. © 2013 IEEE.","biochemical oxygen demand; principal component analysis; river water quality; Semi-arid region","Adaptive boosting; Alkalinity; Biochemical oxygen demand; Decision trees; Dissolved oxygen; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Mean square error; Stochastic systems; Sulfur compounds; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Surface waters; Water conservation; Water quality; Biochemical oxygen demands (BOD); Determination coefficients; Feature extraction algorithms; Principal components analysis; Root mean square errors; Statistical performance; Stochastic gradient boosting; Sustainable water resources; Stochastic models",,,,,"Deanship of Scientific Research, King Faisal University, DSR, KFU: 1/372/42","This work was supported by the Deanship of Scientific Research at King Khalid University under Grant RGP. 1/372/42.",,,,,,,,,,"Luo, Z., Shao, Q., Zuo, Q., Cui, Y., Impact of land use and urbanization on river water quality and ecology in a dam dominated basin (2020) J.

RO membrane performance is affected by many different factors such as feed characteristics and operational parameters during operation. The aim of this study is to analyse the influence of feed characteristics of municipal wastewater (conductivity, oxidation reduction potential (ORP), total suspended solids (TSS), turbidity and chemical oxygen demand (COD)) and operational parameters (feed pressure, flow rate and temperature) on RO membrane performance in a municipal wastewater recovery plant using machine learning (ML) techniques. XGBoost, random forest, artificial neural networks (ANNs) and multiple linear regression (MLR) were employed to predict three RO membrane performance indicators (pressure difference across membranes, salt passage and permeate flow rate). The methods that can predict salt passage, permeate flow rate and pressure difference among membranes with the highest accuracy were found as ANNs, random forest and MLR, respectively. Considering the developed models, temperature was found to be the variable affecting all three RO performance parameters. Salt passage was found to be highly affected by feed water conductivity and feed flow rate was determined to be the most influential parameter for the permeate flow rate and pressure difference. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","artificial neural networks; machine learning; random forest; reverse osmosis membranes; wastewater treatment",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Al-Bastaki, N.M., Al-Qahtani, H.I., Assessment of thermal effects on the reverse osmosis of salt/water solutions by using a spiral wound polyamide membrane (1994) Desalination, 99, pp. 159-168; Bartels, C., Franks, R., Rybar, S., Schierach, M., Wilf, M., The effect of feed ionic strength on salt passage through reverse osmosis membranes (2005) Desalination, 184, pp. 185-195; Boulahfa, H., Belhamidi, S., Elhannouni, F., Taky, M., El Fadil, A., Elmidaoui, A., Demineralization of brackish surface water by reverse osmosis: The first experience in Morocco (2019) J.

Although new sensors have provided novel information about the fine-scale temporal variation of some stream water solutes, we lack adequate sensor technology to gain the same insights for many other solutes. We used two machine learning algorithms – Support Vector Machine and Random Forest – to predict concentrations at 15-min resolution for 10 solutes, of which eight lack specific sensors. The algorithms were trained with data from intensive stream sensing and manual stream sampling (weekly) for four full years in a hydrologic reference stream within the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, USA. The Random Forest algorithm was slightly better at predicting solute concentrations than the Support Vector Machine algorithm (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies ranged from 0.35 to 0.78 for Random Forest compared to 0.29 to 0.79 for Support Vector Machine). Solute predictions were most sensitive to the removal of fluorescent dissolved organic matter, pH and specific conductance as independent variables for both algorithms, and least sensitive to dissolved oxygen and turbidity. The predicted concentrations of calcium and monomeric aluminium were used to estimate catchment solute yield, which changed most dramatically for aluminium because it concentrates with stream discharge. These results show great promise for using a combined approach of stream sensing and intensive stream discrete sampling to build information about the high-frequency variation of solutes for which an appropriate sensor or proxy is not available. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","biogeochemistry; machine learning; stream solutes; water quality","Aluminum; Catchments; Data streams; Decision trees; Dissolved oxygen; Forecasting; Learning systems; Random forests; Water quality; Dissolved organic matters; Hubbard Brook experimental forest; Independent variables; Random forest algorithm; Solute concentrations; Stream solute concentrations; Support vector machine algorithm; Water quality sensors; Support vector machines; algorithm; computer simulation; frequency analysis; machine learning; numerical model; pH; streamwater; support vector machine; water quality; New Hampshire; United States",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1637685, 1907683",,,,,,,,,,,"Allan, J.D., Ibañez Castillo, M.M., (2009) Stream ecology: Structure and function of running waters, , Dordrecht, Springer; Aubert, A.H., Breuer, L., New seasonal shift in in-stream diurnal nitrate cycles identified by mining high-frequency data (2016) PLoS One, 11; Aulenbach, B.T., Effects of climate-related variability in storage on streamwater solute concentrations and fluxes in a small forested watershed in the southeastern United States (2020) Hydrological Processes, 34 (2), pp. 189-208; Aulenbach, B.T., Burns, D.A., Shanley, J.B., Yanai, R.D., Bae, K., Wild, A.D., Yang, Y., Yi, D., Approaches to stream solute load estimation for solutes with varying dynamics from five diverse small watersheds (2016) Ecosphere, 7; Bailey, A.S., Hornbeck, J.W., Campbell, J.L., Eagar, C., (2003) Hydrometeorological database for Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest: 1955–2000.

Different approaches have been employed in the treatment and monitoring of water quality parameters (WQP). Presently, water quality is carried out through laboratory experiments, which requires costly reagents, skilled labor, and consumes time. Thereby making it necessary to search for an alternative method. Recently, machine learning tools have been successfully implemented in the monitoring, estimation, and predictions of river water quality index to provide an alternative solution to the limitations of laboratory analytical methods. In this study, the potentials of one of the machine learning tools (artificial neural network) were explored in the predictions and estimation of the Kelantan River basin. Water quality data collected from the 14 stations of the River basin was used for modeling and predicting (WQP). As for WQP analysis, the results obtained from this study show that the best prediction was obtained from the prediction of pH. The low kurtosis values of pH indicate that the appearance of outliers give a negative impact on the performance. As for WQP analysis for each station, we found that the WQP prediction in station 1, 2, and 3 give the good results.

The genetic algorithm was constructed such that a notable improvement in the model could be achieved, within a short period of time. Two sets of models were developed based on high and low turbidity values. The genetic algorithm improved the correlation coefficient (R) and the mean squared error (MSE) of the low turbidity model from 0.76 and 2.16 × 10-4 to 0.81 and 4.85 × 10-5 respectively, in 15 minutes; whilst improving R and MSE of the high turbidity model from 0.62 and 0.0011 to 0.93 to 2.89 × 10-4 respectively, in 2 minutes. The ability of the model to capture the reported variation of TW turbidity with gradually increasing coagulant dosage was also tested. It was noted that ELM-RBF was more capable of capturing such physical and chemical phenomena better than multilayer perceptron and ELM-single layer feed-forward models. The genetic algorithm improved the ability of the model to capture the parametric behavior of TW turbidity too. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The practice of water quality management can be evolved introducing a Geographic Information Systems dashboard that incorporates Artificial Intelligence models to predict environmental parameters in real-time. This study presents an operational dashboard that integrates Machine Learning model using the data collected from the SRBC's 62 different model sites from 2010 to 2019. Five daily time-series parameters were selected such as temperature, turbidity, pH, specific conductance, and dissolved oxygen.

Among these nutrients, nitrogen and phosphorus are two of the most important harmful cyanobacterial bloom (HCB) drivers. A reliable prediction of these parameters, therefore, is necessary for the management of rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. The aim of this study is to test the suitability of the powerful machine learning (ML) algorithm, random forest (RF), to provide information on water quality parameters for the Tri An Reservoir (TAR). Three species of nitrogen and phosphorus, including nitrite (N-NO2−), nitrate (N-NO3−), and phosphate (P-PO43−), were empirically estimated using the field observation dataset (2009–2014) of six surrogates of total suspended solids (TSS), total dissolved solids (TDS), turbidity, electrical conductivity (EC), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5). Field data measurement showed that water quality in the TAR was eutrophic with an up-trend of N-NO3− and P-PO43− during the study period. The RF regression model was reliable for N-NO2−, N-NO3−, and P-PO43− prediction with a high R2 of 0.812–0.844 for the training phase (2009–2012) and 0.888–0.903 for the validation phase (2013–2014). The results of land use and land cover change (LUCC) revealed that deforestation and shifting agriculture in the upper region of the basin were the major factors increasing nutrient loading in the TAR. Among the meteorological parameters, rainfall pattern was found to be one of the most influential factors in eutrophication, followed by average sunshine hour. Our results are expected to provide an advanced assessment tool for predicting nutrient loading and for giving an early warning of HCB in the TAR. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Harmful cyanobacterial blooms;

Because of the great dependence of fishes on the condition of the aquatic environment, the water quality can directly affect their activity. Therefore monitoring water quality is a very important issue to consider, especially in the fish farming industry. In this paper a digital fish farm monitoring system is introduced and a collection of experimental data of water quality monitoring was presented, which were directly collected from a fish pond. As the quality factor of water affects its aquatic life form sustainability, therefore the quality factors of the water were measured using digital sensors. Temperature, pH factor and Turbidity were selected as the basic quality factors to measure. The dataset contains data recorded from two different water levels to analyze the aquatic environment more efficiently. Each level has 9623 sets of data of the selected parameters. Collection was continued all day long for several days. Later collected sensor data were analyzed as short period time series to find its properties. Machine Learning regression method was used to predict near future conditions. Moreover data were processed to find any repetitive patterns in its properties. This dataset represents the exact condition of the environment of the fish pond. Therefore it can be used to develop a system to monitor fish farms digitally. Using these data in machine learning, predicting the future is possible for advance monitoring of a fish farm. The dataset is available in Mendeley Data [1]. © 2020 The Authors","Digital sensors; Fish farm monitoring; Internet of things; Machine learning; Micro-controller; Notification system; Real time monitoring; Water quality factors",,,,,,,"This work was supported by Electronics and Communication Engineering Discipline at Khulna University, Bangladesh.",,,,,,,,,,"Nahid, A.-A., Arafat, A.I., Akter, T., Ahammed, M.F., Ali, M.Y., KU-MWQ: a dataset for monitoring water quality using digital sensors (2020) Mendeley Data, V4; Li, D., Liu, S., Remote monitoring of water quality for intensive fish culture (2013) Smart Sensors for Real-Time Water Quality Monitoring.

Here, we aimed to detect anomalies caused by technical errors in water-quality (turbidity and conductivity) data collected by automated in situ sensors deployed in contrasting riverine and estuarine environments. We first applied a range of artificial neural networks that differed in both learning method and hyperparameter values, then calibrated models using a Bayesian multiobjective optimization procedure, and selected and evaluated the ""best""model for each water-quality variable, environment, and anomaly type. We found that semi-supervised classification was better able to detect sudden spikes, sudden shifts, and small sudden spikes, whereas supervised classification had higher accuracy for predicting long-term anomalies associated with drifts and periods of otherwise unexplained high variability. ©",,"Anomaly detection; Bayesian networks; Learning systems; Multiobjective optimization; Supervised learning; Water quality; Environmental conditions; Environmental data; Estuarine environments; High frequency HF; Semi-supervised classification; Supervised classification; Water quality data; Water quality variables; Neural networks; fresh water; river water; water; artificial neural network; data set; detection method; technical efficiency; water quality; analytical error; Article; artificial neural network; Bayes theorem; controlled study; data analysis; electric conductivity; measurement accuracy; multiobjective optimization; outlier detection; semi supervised machine learning; time series analysis; turbidity; water quality; water quality; Elliptio dilatata; Bayes Theorem; Neural Networks, Computer; Water; Water Quality",,"water, 7732-18-5; Water",,,"Department of Environment and Science, Queensland Government, DES; Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Mathematical and Statistical Frontiers, ACEMS","Funding was provided by the Energy Environment Solutions (E2S-UPPA) consortium and the BIGCEES project from E2S-UPPA (“Big model and Big data in Computational Ecology and Environmental Sciences”), the Queensland Department of Environment and Science (DES) and the ARC Centre of Excellence for Mathematical and Statistical Frontiers (ACEMS).

Detection of disinfectant (monochloramine) can be better achieved by separating its spectra from the combined spectra. In this paper, two major focuses are (i) the separation of monochloramine spectra from the combined spectra and (ii) assessment of the application of the machine learning algorithm in real-time detection of monochloramine. The support vector regression (SVR) model was developed using multi-wavelength ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorbance spectra and online amperometric monochloramine residual measurement data. The performance of the SVR model was evaluated by using four different kernel functions. Results show that (i) particles or turbidity in water have a significant effect on UV-Vis spectral measurement and improved modelling accuracy is achieved by using particle compensated spectra; (ii) modelling performance is further improved by compensating the spectra for natural organic matter (NOM) and nitrate (NO3) and (iii) the choice of kernel functions greatly affected the SVR performance, especially the radial basis function (RBF) appears to be the highest performing kernel function. The outcomes of this research suggest that disinfectant residual (monochloramine) can be measured in real time using the SVR algorithm with a precision level of ± 0.1 mg L−1. © 2020 by the authors.

Numerous studies have shown that cyanotoxins from these harmful algal blooms (HABs) can be transported to and assimilated into crops when present in irrigation waters. Phycocyanin is a pigment known only to occur in cyanobacteria and is often used to indicate cyanobacteria presence in waters. The objective of this work was to identify the most influential environmental covariates affecting the phycocyanin concentrations in agricultural irrigation ponds that experience cyanobacteria blooms of the potentially toxigenic species Microcystis and Aphanizomenon using machine learning methodology. The study was performed at two agricultural irrigation ponds over a 5-month period in the summer of 2018. Phycocyanin concentrations, along with sensor-based and fluorometer-based water quality parameters including turbidity (NTU), pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), fluorescent dissolved organic matter (fDOM), conductivity, chlorophyll, color dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and extracted chlorophyll were measured. Regression tree analyses were used to determine the most influential water quality parameters on phycocyanin concentrations. Nearshore sampling locations had higher phycocyanin concentrations than interior sampling locations and “zones” of consistently higher concentrations of phycocyanin were found in both ponds. The regression tree analyses indicated extracted chlorophyll, CDOM, and NTU were the three most influential parameters on phycocyanin concentrations. This study indicates that sensor-based and fluorometer-based water quality parameters could be useful to identify spatial patterns of phycocyanin concentrations and therefore, cyanobacteria blooms, in agricultural irrigation ponds and potentially other water bodies. © 2020, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.;

However, incidents such as natural disasters, accidents and intentional damages are endangering the safety of drinking water. With the advance of sensor technologies, different kinds of sensors are being deployed to monitor operative and quality indicators such as flow rate, pH, turbidity, the amount of chlorine dioxide etc. This brings the possibility to detect anomalies in real time based on the data collected from the sensors and different kinds of methods have been applied to tackle this task such as the traditional machine learning methods (e.g. logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest). Recently, researchers tried to apply the deep learning methods (e.g. RNN, CNN) for WDS anomaly detection but the results are worse than that of the traditional machine learning methods. In this paper, by taking into account the characteristics of the WDS monitoring data, we integrate sequence-to-point learning and data balancing with the deep learning model Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) for the task of anomaly detection in WDSs. With a public data set, we show that by choosing an appropriate input length and balance the training data our approach achieves better F1 score than the state-of-the-art method in the literature. © 2020 IEEE.","anomaly detection; deep learning; sensor network; sequence-to-point learning; water quality","Anomaly detection; Balancing; Decision trees; Disasters; Learning systems; Logistic regression; Long short-term memory; Potable water; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Water distribution systems; Chlorine dioxides; Learning methods; Machine learning methods; Natural disasters; Quality indicators; Safety of drinking water; Sensor technologies; State-of-the-art methods; Deep learning",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61873119, 61911530247; Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality: KQJSCX20180322151418232","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 61873119 and 61911530247, and the Science and Technology Innovation Commission of Shenzhen under Grant Nos.

The possibility of a pollutant to be discharged to the river as municipal and industrial waste is an important problem for those using water from rivers. Nevertheless, due to the rapid population growth in the world and the irresponsible use of water resources, the world will face a serious lack of water in the near future. Therefore, the water resources of the future must be preserved very well to leave healthy and enough water for next generations. In order to prevent river water pollution, river water quality should be constantly monitored and evaluated. This way, information on the status of water quality may be obtained, and river basin management planning may be carried out. For this purpose, measurement at points can be made, or online monitoring stations can be established on river basins. According to the collected data, management actions may be created for how waterways function and how pollutants affect evaluation. In addition to this effect, seasonal changes and long-term trends must be taken into consideration. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been used recently in many engineering fields. The most widely used ones among AI techniques are artificial neural networks (ANN). These are followed by support vector regression (SVR), least squares support vector regression (LS-SVR), least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) and fuzzy logic. In the past 15 years, extreme learning machine (ELM) and its types have been used in development of many forecasting models. The statistical accuracy of classical models is commonly poor because natural systems tend to be complex and nonlinear for deterministic modelling methods. AI techniques provide a fast and flexible means of creating models for estimation of river water quality. In recent years, AI techniques have shown exceptional performance as regression tools, especially when used for pattern recognition and function estimation. In this study, AI techniques will be applied to river water quality data, and AI models will be developed. The data were collected from an on-line measurement station that was established on the Yeşilirmak River in Amasya/Turkey. In the selected region, two different measurement stations were built at a distance of about 28 km. Twelve parameters as luminescent dissolved oxygen (LDO), pH, conductivity, nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N), total organic carbon (TOC), chloride, orthophosphate, temperature, turbidity, suspended solid and flow rate were measured at five-minute intervals at these stations. Specifically, two different models as DO prediction and TOC prediction models were developed with five different approaches. These approaches were artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression, least squares support vector regression, extreme learning machine and kernel extreme learning machine. Model performances were evaluated with some performance indices. This study is a state-of-the-art study due to the fact that parameters that are expensive to measure can be predicted from parameters that are cheaper to measure. For this reason, it will contribute significantly to reducing the cost of on-line measurement stations planned to be established in the future. © 2020 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Artificial intelligence; Real-time monitoring; River water quality monitoring",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abba, S.I., Hadi, S.J., Abdullahi, J., River water modelling prediction using multilinear regression, artificial neural network, and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system techniques (2018) Procedia Computer Science, 120, pp. 75-82; Ahmed, A.A.M., Prediction of dissolved oxygen in Surma River by biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand using the artificial neural networks (Anns) (2017) Journal of King Saud University -Engineering Sciences, 29 (2), pp. 151-158; Albadr, M.A.A., Tiun, S., Extreme learning machine: A review (2017) International Journal of Applied Engineering Research, 12 (14), pp. 4610-4623; Bozorg-Haddad, O., Soleimani, S., Loáiciga, H.A., Modeling water-quality parameters using genetic algorithm-least squares support vector regression and genetic programming (2017) Journal of Environmental Engineering, 143 (7); Boztepe, C., Künkül, A., Yüceer, M., Application of artificial intelligence in modeling of the doxorubicin release behavior of pH and temperature responsive poly (NIPAAm-co-AAc)-PEG IPN hydrogel (2020) Journal of Drug Delivery Science and Technology, 57, p. 101603; Chang, F.J., Chen, P., Chang, L., Tsai, Y., Estimating spatiotemporal dynamics of stream total phosphate concentration by soft computing techniques (2016) Science of the Total Environment, 562, pp. 228-236; Chang, F.J., Tsai, Y., Chen, P., Coynel, A., Vachaud, G., Modeling water quality in an urban river using hydrological factors -Data Driven Approaches (2015) Journal of Environmental Management, 151, pp. 87-96; Cortes, C., Vapnik, V., Support-vector networks (1995) Machine Learning, 20, pp. 273-297; Csábrági, A., Molnár, S., Tanos, P., Kovács, J., Forecasting of dissolved oxygen in the River Danube using neural networks (2016) Hungarian Agricultural Engineering, 7410, pp. 38-41; Ding, S., Xu, X., Nie, R., Extreme learning machine and applications (2014) Neuralcomputing and Applications, 25, pp. 549-556; Güneşoğlu, S., Yüceer, A.M., A modeling Study of microcracking processes of polyurethane coated cotton fabrics (2018) Textile Research Journal, 88 (24), pp. 2766-2781; Huang, G.B., Zhu, Q., Siew, C., Extreme learning machine: Theory and applications (2006) Neurocomputing, 70 (1-3), pp. 489-501; Karadurmuş, E., Akyazi, H., Göz, E., Yuceer, M., Prediction of characteristic properties of crude oil blending with ANN (2018) Journal of Dispersion Science and Technology, 39 (9), pp. 1236-1243; Li, B., Rong, X., Li, Y., An improved kernel based extreme learning machine for robot execution failures (2014) The Scientific World Journal, pp. 1-7; Leong, W.C., Bahadori, A., Zhang, J., Ahmad, Z., Prediction of water quality index (WQI) using support vector machine (SVM) and least square-support vector machine (LS-SVM) (2019) International Journal of River Basin Management; McCulloch, W.S., Pitts, W., A logical calculus of the ideas immanent in nervous activity (1943) Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics, 5, pp. 115-133; Nemati, S., Fazelifard, M.H., Terzi, O., Ghorbani, M.A., (2015) Estimation of dissolved oxygen using data-driven techniques in the Tai; River, P., Kong, H., Environmental Earth Sciences, 74 (5), pp. 4065-4073; Olyaie, E., Abyaneh, H.Z., Mehr, A.D., A comparative analysis among computational intelligence techniques for dissolved oxygen prediction in Delaware River (2017) Geoscience Frontiers, 8 (3), pp. 517-527; Rehana, S., River water temperature modelling under climate change using support vector regression (2019) Hydrology in a Changing World, pp. 171-183. , edited by Singh S., Dhanya C.

Traditional modeling approaches the problem through a physical and chemical understanding of the complicated fouling phenomena. In this study, a large amount of data has been collected from a pilot-scale ultrafiltration membrane system treating spent filter backwash water at a water treatment plant. Environmental variables and operational parameters including temperature, hydraulic pressure, water turbidity, etc. are monitored continuously. This work focuses on revealing the hidden nonlinear relationships of these variables via data driven methodologies without building a first principles process model. Machine learning tools are used to establish a connection between environmental variables, dynamic parameters, the efficiency of foulant removal through backwashing, and the increase rate of foulants. The prediction performance is compared to regression models including linear regression, artificial neural networks, and random forests. Our data driven model of the fouling dynamics is then used for optimization purposes, in particular, to optimize the backwashing sequence timing by applying tools from stochastic dynamic programming. Optimized backwash performance is compared with experimental data acquired via a fixed interval sequence and shows a more efficient schedule at less cost and with lower membrane resistance. This work establishes a full pipeline of data processing, model building, and operational optimization. The only requirement for employing our methodology is the collection of operational data, in order to identify the membrane dynamics. The reported methodology offers a great potential for implementation on large-scale ultrafiltration applications, which can improve energy consumption and elongate membrane life. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Data-driven modeling; Membrane backwash; Pilot-scale experiment; System optimization; Ultrafiltration membrane","Data handling; Decision trees; Energy utilization; Membranes; Regression analysis; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Ultrafiltration; Water treatment; Environmental variables; First principles process; Non-linear relationships; Operational optimization; Spent filter backwash water; Stochastic dynamic programming; Ultra-filtration membranes; Ultrafiltration membrane systems; Dynamic programming; Article; artificial neural network; controlled study; energy consumption; flow rate; membrane resistance; priority journal; random forest; surface area; turbidity; ultrafiltration; water quality; water treatment; Data Processing; Fouling; Membranes; Optimization; Regression Analysis; Ultrafiltration; Water Treatment",,,,,"U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA: 2018-68011-28371","This research is supported in part by Cobb County Marietta Water Authority , Litree Water Purification Company , and the United States Department of Agriculture (Grant No. 2018-68011-28371 ).",,,,,,,,,,"Chellam, S., Jacangelo, J.G., Bonacquisti, T.P., Modeling and experimental verification of pilot-scale hollow fiber, direct flow microfiltration with periodic backwashing (1998) Environ.

For a gray target positioned at 7 m downrange, ≥97% target detection accuracy was achieved at turbidities of \mathrm{c}\leq 0.8\ \mathrm{m}^{-1}, ranging from clear waters up to simulated open ocean conditions, and ≥85% target accuracy was achieved at simulated harbor-like turbidities of 1.0\ \mathrm{m}^{-1}\leq \mathrm{c}\leq 1.2\ \mathrm{m}^{-1}, where c is the attenuation coefficient of the turbid water.

The 3U cubesat constellation of Planet Labs offers the capability of imaging the whole Earth landmass everyday at 3-4mspatial resolution. The higher spatial, as well as temporal resolution of PlanetScope imagery in comparison with Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, makes it a valuable data source for monitoring the glacial lakes. Therefore, this paper explores the potential of the PlanetScope imagery for glacial lakes mapping with a focus on the Hindu Kush, Karakoram and Himalaya (HKKH) region. Though the revisit time of the PlanetScope imagery is short, courtesy of 130+ small satellites, this imagery contains only four bands and the imaging sensors in these small satellites exhibit varying spectral responses as well as lower dynamic range. Furthermore, the presence of cast shadows in the mountainous regions and varying spectral signature of the water pixels due to differences in composition, turbidity and depth makes it challenging to automatically and reliably extract surface water in PlanetScope imagery. Keeping in view these challenges, this work uses state of the art deep learning models for pixel-wise classification of PlanetScope imagery into the water and background pixels and compares the results with Random Forest and Support Vector Machine classifiers. The deep learning model is based on the popular U-Net architecture. We evaluate U-Net architecture similar to the original U-Net as well as a U-Net with a pre-trained EfficientNet backbone. In order to train the deep neural network, ground truth data are generated by manual digitization of the surface water in PlanetScope imagery with the aid of Very High Resolution Satellite (VHRS) imagery. The created dataset consists of more than 5000 water bodies having an area of approx. 71 km2 in eight different sites in the HKKH region. The evaluation of the test data show that the U-Net with EfficientNet backbone achieved the highest F1 Score of 0.936. A visual comparison with the existing glacial lake inventories is then performed over the Baltoro glacier in the Karakoram range. The results show that the deep learning model detected significantly more lakes than the existing inventories, which have been derived from Landsat OLI imagery. The trained model is further evaluated on the time series PlanetScope imagery of two glacial lakes, which have resulted in an outburst flood. The output of the U-Net is also compared with the GLakeMap data. The results show that the higher spatial and temporal resolution of PlanetScope imagery is a significant advantage in the context of glacial lakes mapping and monitoring. © 2020 by the authors.","Baltoro glacier; Chitral; EfficientNet; GLOF; Shishper glacier surge; U-Net",,,,,,"International Foundation for Science, IFS; Ministerial Standing Committee on Scientific and Technological Cooperation of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, COMSTECH: W/5805-1","Funding: This research was supported by the International Foundation for Science (IFS) and COMSTECH grant Ref.

For example, shellfish growing areas may be impacted by harmful algal blooms or runoff from land that increases turbidity, lowers salinity, or introduces contaminants. Shellfish resource managers in the Chesapeake Bay are especially concerned with sources of bacteria from land such as failing onsite waste systems, failing wastewater infrastructure, and concentrated animal feeding operations. There is an urgent need for remote sensing of water quality indicators beyond chlorophyll-a and suspended sediments to augment field sampling programs. Artificial Intelligence trained with simultaneous in situ and satellite observations is explored in preparation for future hyperspectral satellite missions, which offer potential to detect additional water quality indicators not previously possible.

In this regard, the principal component analysis was performed on the input time series decomposed by a discrete wavelet transform to feed the ANN/ANFIS models. The models were applied for dissolved oxygen (DO) forecasting in rivers which is an important variable affecting aquatic life and water quality. The current values of DO, water surface temperature, salinity, and turbidity have been considered as the input variable to forecast DO in a three-time step further. The results of the study revealed that PCA can be employed as a powerful tool for dimension reduction of input variables and also to detect inter-correlation of input variables. Results of the PCA-wavelet-ANN models are compared with those obtained from wavelet-ANN models while the earlier one has the advantage of less computational time than the later models. Dealing with ANFIS models, PCA is more beneficial to avoid wavelet-ANFIS models creating too many rules which deteriorate the efficiency of the ANFIS models. Moreover, manipulating the wavelet-ANFIS models utilizing PCA leads to a significant decreasing in computational time. Finally, it was found that the PCA-wavelet-ANN/ANFIS models can provide reliable forecasts of dissolved oxygen as an important water quality indicator in rivers. © 2020 by the authors.","Dimensionality reduction; Machine learning; Principal component analysis; Water quality; Wavelet transform",,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG; Bauhaus-Universität Weimar","Acknowledgments: We acknowledge the support of the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar within the Open-Access Publishing Programme.",,,,,,,,,,"Cox, B., A review of dissolved oxygen modelling techniques for lowland rivers (2003) Sci.

Decisions on how to mitigate food safety risks associated with pre-harvest water use currently rely on generic Escherichia coli-based water quality tests, although multiple studies have suggested that E. coli levels are not a suitable indicator of the food safety risks under all relevant environmental conditions. Hence, improved understanding of spatiotemporal variability in surface water microbiota composition is needed to facilitate identification of alternative or supplementary indicators that co-occur with pathogens. To this end, we aimed to characterize the composition of bacterial and fungal communities in the sediment and water fractions of 68 agricultural water samples collected from six New York streams. We investigated potential associations between the composition of microbial communities, environmental factors and Salmonella and/or Listeria monocytogenes isolation. We found significantly different composition of fungal and bacterial communities among sampled streams and among water fractions of collected samples. This indicates that geography and the amount of sediment in a collected water sample may affect its microbial composition, which was further supported by identified associations between the flow rate, turbidity, pH and conductivity, and microbial community composition. Lastly, we identified specific microbial families that were weakly associated with the presence of Salmonella or Listeria monocytogenes, however, further studies on samples from additional streams are needed to assess whether identified families may be used as indicators of pathogen presence. © Copyright © 2020 Chung, Weller and Kovac.","agricultural water; food safety; microbial communities; produce safety; surface water","RNA 16S; Alteromonadaceae; Article; bacterium isolation; Betaproteobacteria; cyanobacterium; DNA extraction; environmental factor; foodborne pathogen; fungal community; illumina sequencing; Listeria monocytogenes; machine learning; microbial community; Mycobacteriaceae; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; quality control; Rhodobacteraceae; water quality",,,"2100 Bioanalyzer, Agilent, United States; NanoDrop spectrophotometer, Thermo, United States","Qiagen, Germany; Agilent, United States; Thermo, United States","National Institutes of Health, NIH: T32ES007271; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, NIFA: 04646, 1015787; Cornell University, CU; College of Agricultural Sciences, Pennsylvania State University; Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences","This work was supported by the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture Hatch Appropriations under Project #PEN04646 and Accession #1015787, the Penn State College of Agricultural Sciences and the Department of Food Science.

The preservation and improvement of the quality of our impaired urban streams are at the core of the global challenge of ensuring water sustainability. This work adopted a genetic-algorithm (GA)-optimized long short-term memory (LSTM) technique to predict river water temperature (WT) as a key indicator of the health state of the aquatic habitat, where its modeling is crucial for effective urban water quality management. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to adopt a GA-LSTM to predict the WT in urban rivers. In recent research trends, large volumes of real-time water quality data, including water temperature, conductivity, pH, and turbidity, are constantly being collected. Specifically, in the field of water quality management, this provides countless opportunities for understanding water quality impairment and forecasting, and to develop models for aquatic habitat assessment purposes. The main objective of this research was to develop a reliable and simple urban river water temperature forecasting tool using advanced machine learning methods that can be used in conjunction with a real-time network of water quality monitoring stations for proactive water quality management. We proposed a hybrid time series regression model for WT forecasting. This hybrid approach was applied to solve problems regarding the time window size and architectural factors (number of units) of the LSTM network. We have chosen an hourly water temperature record collected over 5 years as the input. Furthermore, to check its robustness, a recurrent neural network (RNN) was also tested as a benchmark model and the performances were compared. The experimental results revealed that the hybrid model of the GA-LSTM network outperformed the RNN and the basic problem of determining the optimal time window and number of units of the memory cell was solved. This research concluded that the GA-LSTM can be used as an advanced deep learning technique for time series analysis. © 2020 by the authors.","Genetic algorithm; LSTM; Sequential model; Water temperature","artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; genetic algorithm; machine learning; optimization; performance assessment; real time; sustainability; water management; water temperature",,,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC: 050235, 400675","Funding: This research was funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery Grant (#400675) and was in partnership with an Ontario Ministry of Transportation Grant (#050235).","This research was funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery Grant (#400675) and was in partnership with an Ontario Ministry of Transportation Grant (#050235).

Dissolved oxygen is an irrigation water quality parameter related to organic matter loading. Low values of dissolved oxygen can cause crop root hypoxia and, therefore, agronomic problems. Thus, an accurate prediction of dissolved oxygen values could be of great interest, especially if effluents are used in micro-irrigation systems. The aim of this study was to obtain a predictive model able to forecast the dissolved oxygen values at the outlets of sand media filters. In this study, a Gaussian process regression (GPR) model was used for predicting the output dissolved oxygen (DOo) from data corresponding to 547 filtration cycles of different sand filters using reclaimed effluent. This optimisation technique involves kernel parameter setting in the GPR training procedure, which significantly influences the regression accuracy. To this end, the height of the filter bed, filtration velocity and filter inlet values of the electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity and water temperature were monitored and analysed. The significance of each variable on filtration performance is presented and a model for forecasting the outlet dissolved oxygen obtained. Regression with optimal hyperparameters was performed and a coefficient of determination of 0.90 for DOo was obtained when this new predictive GPR–based model was applied to the experimental dataset. Agreement between experimental data and the model confirmed the good performance of the latter. © 2020 IAgrE","Bayesian statistics; Clogging; Drip irrigation; Effluents; Gaussian process regression; Machine learning techniques","Dissolution; Effluents; Forecasting; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Irrigation; Regression analysis; Sand; Water filtration; Water quality; Electrical conductivity; Filtration performance; Gaussian process regression; Irrigation water quality; Microirrigation systems; Optimisation techniques; Predictive modeling; Training procedures; Dissolved oxygen",,,,,"AGL2015-63750-R, RTI2018-094798-B-100","Authors wish to acknowledge the computational support provided by the Department of Mathematics at University of Oviedo as well as financial support of the Spanish Research Agency through grants AGL2015-63750-R and RTI2018-094798-B-100 .

Thus, water monitoring in different water resources has been practiced to ensure safe drinking water. However, manual monitoring of safe drinking water is known to be inconvenient since it requires high operational and transportation costs, and time consuming. This study develops a data-driven water classification model for rural household areas using sensor nodes and machine learning algorithm. Sensor nodes are installed in several water sources in different rural areas to collect water parameters such as pH, turbidity, total dissolved solids, and temperature which are wirelessly transmitted to a base station. The collected sensor data is used to build and train the model to classify water potability using a hard-voting method in ensemble learning. The ensemble learning combined three machine learning algorithms namely k-nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, and Classification and Regression Tree. Finally, data are sent to a cloud for data storage and remote monitoring. Results show that the voting classifier model achieves an accuracy of 97% compared with other stand-alone classification algorithms. Furthermore, the model achieves 90% match with conventional industrial laboratory test. © 2020 ASEAN University Network/Southeast Asia Engineering Education Development Network.

However, forecasting hourly outflow sediment concentration is difficult because of complex physical processes and high temporal variability. This study proposes an outflow sediment concentration forecasting model (SOSVMAR) that integrates self-organizing map (SOM), support vector machine (SVM) and autoregressive method (AR) to overcome the poor representation of outflow sediment concentration extremes. SOSVMAR primarily uses SOM to extract valuable data and to identify the most salient features that are regarded as reprocessed input of SVM for precision improvement. After data extraction, AR is used for real-time correcting the model forecasts. An application in the Shihmen reservoir, which is the most important multi-purpose reservoir in northern Taiwan, was conducted to demonstrate the forecasting performance of the proposed model. Due to the 34.65% of storage capacity has been lost in the Shihmen reservoir, it is an urgent task to increase the efficiency of desiltation. In this study, SOSVMAR, SOSVM integrated with SOM and SVM without AR and traditional SVM are compared. Results indicate that the SOSVMAR outperforms SOSVM and SVM by accurately forecasting the maximum outflow sediment concentration and long lead time forecasting. By comparing the root mean square error of the results from SOSVM with SOSVMAR, SOSVMAR significantly improving percentage at the power plant intake and bottom outlet for long lead time forecasting (3 h lead time) is 40% and 35%, respectively. SOSVMAR can provide accurate forecasts because it uses the reprocess model and real-time correction. Thus, the proposed model can be applied to provide useful forecasting information for reservoir sediment management during desilting operations in a reservoir. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Autoregressive method; Desilting operations; Outflow sediment concentration; Reservoir sediment management; Self-organizing map; Support vector machine","Conformal mapping; Data mining; Digital storage; Efficiency; Forecasting; Mean square error; Ocean currents; Power plant intakes; Reservoir management; Reservoirs (water); Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Self organizing maps; Support vector machines; Autoregressive methods; Complex physical process; Forecasting performance; Precision improvement; Real-time corrections; Root mean square errors; Sediment concentration; Temporal variability; Time series analysis; accuracy assessment; forecasting method; machine learning; outflow; precision; sediment analysis; siltation; time series analysis; Shihmen Reservoir; Taiwan",,,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST: 105-2221-E-002 -063 -MY3, 107-2625-M-002 -002","Funding was provided by Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (Grant Nos. 107-2625-M-002 -002 and 105-2221-E-002 -063 -MY3).",,,,,,,,,,"Agarwal, A., Maheswaran, R., Kurths, J., Khosa, R., Wavelet spectrum and self-organizing maps-based approach for hydrologic regionalization—a case study in the western United States (2016) Water Resour Manag, 30 (12), pp. 4399-4413; Akiyama, J., Stefan, H.G., Plunging flow into a reservoir-theory (1984) J Hydraul Eng, 110, pp. 484-499; Anderson, O.D., (1976) Time series analvsis and forecasting: the Box–Jenkins approach, , Butterworths, London; Annandale, G.W., (2005) Reservoir sedimentation, , Elsevier, New York; Annandale, G.W., Morris, G.L., Karki, P., (2016) Extending the life of reservoirs: sustainable sediment management for dams and run-of-river hydropower, , World Bank Group, Washington; Banihabib, M.E., Bandari, R., Peralta, R.C., Auto-regressive neural-network models for long lead-time forecasting of daily flow (2019) Water Resour Manag, 33, pp. 159-172; Brad, J.F., An efficient point algorithm for a linear two-stage optimization problem (1983) Oper Res, 31, pp. 670-684; Broersen, P.M.T., Error correction of rainfall-runoff models with the ARMAsel program (2007) IEEE Trans Instrum Meas, 56 (6), pp. 2212-2219; Buyukyildiz, M., Kumcu, S.Y., An estimation of the suspended sediment load using adaptive network based fuzzy inference system, support vector machine and artificial neural network models (2017) Water Resour Manag, 31 (4), pp. 1343-1359; Chamoun, S., de Cesare, G., Schleiss, A.J., Experimental investigation on turbidity current venting under restrained outflow discharges (2016) Proceedings of River Flow, , London; Chamoun, S., De Cesare, G., Schleiss, A.J., Influence of operational timing on the efficiency of venting turbidity currents (2018) J Hydraul Res, 144 (9), p. 04018062; Chang, L.C., Amin, M.Z., Yamg, S.N., Chang, F.J., Building ANN-based regional multi-step-ahead flood inundation forecast models (2018) Water, 10, p. 1283; Chang, M.J., Chang, H.K., Chen, Y.C., Lin, G.F., Chen, P.A., Lai, J.S., Tan, Y.C., A support vector machine forecasting model for typhoon flood inundation mapping and early flood warning systems (2018) Water, 10 (12), p. 1734; Chen, Y., Qin, B., Liu, T., Liu, Y., Li, S., The comparison of SOM and K-means for text clustering (2010) Comput Inf Sci, 3 (2), p. 268; Cristianini, N., Shaw-Taylor, J., (2000) An Introduction to support vector machines and other kernel-based learning methods, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Geisser, S., (1993) Predictive inference, , Chapman and Hall, New York; Guo, G., Liu, S., Wu, Y., Li, J., Zhou, R., Zhu, X., Short-term water demand forecast based on deep learning method (2018) J Water Resour Plan Manag, 144 (12), p. 04018076; Hebbert, B., Imberger, J., Loh, I., Patterson, J., Collie river underflow into Wellington reservoir (1979) J Hydraul Div, 105, pp. 533-545; Himanshu, S.K., Pandey, A., Yadav, B., Ensemble wavelet-support vector machine approach for prediction of suspended sediment load using hydrometeorological data (2017) J Hydrol Eng, 22 (7), p. 05017006; Huang, C.C., Fang, H.T., Ho, H.C., Jhong, B.C., Interdisciplinary application of numerical and machine-learning-based models to predict half-hourly suspended sediment concentrations during typhoons (2019) J Hydrol, 573, pp. 661-675; Huang, C.C., Lai, Y.G., Lai, J.S., Tan, Y.C., Field and numerical modeling study of turbidity current in Shimen reservoir during typhoon events (2019) J Hydraul Eng, 145 (5), p. 05019003; Kalra, A., Ahmad, S., Using oceanic-atmospheric oscillations for long lead time streamflow forecasting (2009) Water Resour Res, 45 (3), p.

The objectives of this review were to analyze recent advances in water quality remote sensing and determine limitations of current systems, estimation methods, and suggest future improvements. To that end, we collected over 200 sets of water quality data including blue-green algae phycocyanin (BGA-PC), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), dissolved oxygen (DO), specific conductivity (SC), fluorescent dissolved organic matter (fDOM), turbidity, and pollution-sediments from 2016 to 2018. The water quality data, generated from laboratory analysis of grab samples and in-situ real-time monitoring sensors distributed in eight lakes and rivers in Midwestern United States, were paired with synchronous proximal spectra, tripod-mounted hyperspectral imagery, and satellite data. The results showed that both proximal and satellite-based sensors have great potential to provide accurate estimate of optically active parameters, and remote sensing of non-optically active parameters may be indirectly estimated but still remains a challenge. Data-driven empirical approaches, i.e., deep learning outperformed the other competing methods, providing promising possibility for operational use of remote sensing in water quality monitoring and decision-making. As the first-time review of deep neural networks for water quality estimation, the paper concludes that anomaly detection utilizing multi-sensor data fusion and virtual constellation in cloud-computing is the most promising means for predicting impending water pollution outbreaks such as algal blooms. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Cloud computing; Deep learning; Long short-term memory neural network; Remote sensing.; Water quality","artificial neural network; decision making; dissolved oxygen; machine learning; parameter estimation; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; water quality; United States; algae; Chlorophyta",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: IIA-1355406, IIA-1430427; National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA: NNX15AK03H","This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation ( IIA-1355406 and IIA-1430427 ) and in part by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NNX15AK03H ).",,,,,,,,,,"Albert, A., Gege, P., Inversion of irradiance and remote sensing reflectance in shallow water between 400 and 800 nm for calculations of water and bottom properties (2006) Appl.

Accurate prediction of water quality is the key to improving water management and pollution control. In this paper, two novel hybrid decision tree-based machine learning models are proposed to obtain more accurate short-term water quality prediction results. The basic models of the two hybrid models are extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and random forest (RF), which respectively introduce an advanced data denoising technique - complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN). Taking the water resources of Gales Creek site in Tualatin River (one of the most polluted rivers in the world) Basin as an example, a total of 1875 data (hourly data) from May 1, 2019 to July 20, 2019 are collected. Two hybrid models are used to predict six water quality indicators, including water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH value, specific conductance, turbidity, and fluorescent dissolved organic matter. Six error metrics are introduced as the basis of performance evaluation, and the results of the two models are compared with the other four conventional models. The results reveal that: (1) CEEMDAN-RF performs best in the prediction of temperature, dissolved oxygen and specific conductance, the mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) are 0.69%, 1.05%, and 0.90%, respectively. CEEMDAN-XGBoost performs best in the prediction of pH value, turbidity, and fluorescent dissolved organic matter, the MAPEs are 0.27%, 14.94%, and 1.59%, respectively. (2) The average MAPEs of CEEMDAN-RF and CEEMMDAN-XGBoost models are the smallest, which are 3.90% and 3.71% respectively, indicating that their overall prediction performance is the best. In addition, the stability of the prediction model is also discussed in this paper. The analysis shows that the prediction stability of CEEMDAN-RF and CEEMDAN-XGBoost is higher than other benchmark models. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Data denoising; Decision tree-based model; Extreme gradient boosting; Random forest; Short-term; Water quality prediction","Biogeochemistry; Decision trees; Dissolution; Dissolved oxygen; Fluorescence; Forecasting; Machine learning; Organic compounds; pH; Quality control; Random forests; River pollution; Turbidity; Water management; Water pollution control; Water quality; Data de-noising; Gradient boosting; Short term; Tree-based model; Water quality predictions; Biochemical oxygen demand; dissolved organic matter; dissolved oxygen; water; oxygen; water; bootstrapping; decision support system; decomposition; dissolved oxygen; economic development; empirical analysis; error analysis; hydraulic conductivity; machine learning; prediction; turbidity; water management; water quality; water resource; water temperature; Article; conductance; decision tree; empirical mode decomposition; extreme gradient boosting; machine learning; pH; random forest; river; turbidity; water quality; water supply; water temperature; environmental monitoring; human; procedures; statistical model; temperature; water pollution; water quality; Oregon; Tualatin Basin; United States; Decision Trees; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Machine Learning; Models, Statistical; Oxygen; Rivers; Temperature; Water; Water Pollution; Water Quality",,"water, 7732-18-5; oxygen, 7782-44-7; Oxygen; Water",,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 71901184; Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE: 19YJCZH119; China Scholarship Council, CSC: 201708030006; Southwest Petroleum University, SWPU: PLN201710; State Key Laboratory of Oil and Gas Reservoir Geology and Exploitation","This article is funded by Open Fund of State Key Laboratory of Oil and Gas Reservoir Geology and Exploitation ( Southwest Petroleum University ) ( PLN201710 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 71901184 ), Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China ( 19YJCZH119 ), and China Scholarship Council ( 201708030006 ).",,,,,,,,,,"Bian, X., Song, Y., Mwamukonda, M., Fu, Y., Prediction of the sulfur solubility in pure H2S and sour gas by intelligent models (2020) J.

Traditional monitoring techniques, although highly accurate, are vastly insufficient in terms of spatial and temporal coverage. Using a virtual constellation by harmonizing Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data a high temporal frequency dataset can be created at a relatively fine spatial scale. In this study, we apply a novel deep learning method for the estimation of blue-green algae (BGA), chlorophyll-α (Chl), fluorescent dissolved organic matter (fDOM), dissolved oxygen (DO), specific conductance (SC), and turbidity. The developed model is evaluated against previously studied machine learning methods and found to outperform multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector machine regression (SVR), and extreme learning machine regression (ELR) generating R2 of 0.91 for BGA, 0.88, 0.89, 0.93, 0.87, and 0.84 for Chl, DO, SC, and turbidity respectfully. This model is then applied to all available data ranging from 2013–2018 and time series for each variable were generated for four selected waterbodies. We then use the Empirical Data Analytics (EDA) anomaly detection method on the time series to identify abnormal data points. Upon further analysis, the EDA method successfully identifies abnormal events in water quality. Our results also demonstrate strong correlation between non-optically active variables such as SC with Chl and fDOM. The framework developed in this study represents an efficient and accurate empirical method for inland water quality monitoring at the regional scale. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","anomaly detection; Deep learning; virtual constellation; water quality","anomaly; chlorophyll; cyanobacterium; dissolved inorganic matter; dissolved oxygen; estimation method; Landsat; machine learning; parallel computing; satellite constellation; Sentinel; stomatal conductance; turbidity; water quality; Midwest; United States; Chlorophyta",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: IIA-1355406, IIA-1430427; National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA: NNX15AK03H; Saint Louis University, SLU","This research received no additional funding; National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NNX15AK03H]; National Science Foundation [IIA-1355406; IIA-1430427].

To date, publications on eDNA protocol optimization have focused primarily on DNA yield. Therefore, it has not been possible to evaluate the cost and speed of specific components of the eDNA protocol, such as water filtration and DNA extraction method when designing or choosing an eDNA protocol. At the same time, these two parameters are essential for the experimental design of a project. Here we evaluate and rank 27 different eDNA protocols in the context of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) eDNA detection in an estuarine environment. We present a comprehensive evaluation of multiple eDNA protocol parameters, balancing time, cost and DNA yield. We collected samples composed of 500 mL estuarine water from Deverton Slough (3811’16.7""N 12158’34.5""W) and 500 mL from tank water containing 1.3 juvenile Chinook Salmon per liter. Then, we compared extraction methods, filter types, use of inhibitor removal kit for DNA yield, processing time, and protocol cost. Lastly, we used an MCMC algorithm together with machine learning to understand the DNA yield of each step of the protocol as well as the interactions between those steps. Glass fiber filtration was to be the most resilient to high turbidites, filtering the samples in 2.32 ± 0.08 min instead of 14.16 ± 1.86 min and 6.72 ± 1.99 min for nitrocellulose and paper filter N1, respectively. The filtration DNA yield percentages for paper filter N1, glass fiber, and nitrocellulose were 0.00045 ± 0.00013, 0.00107 ± 0.00013, 0.00172 ± 0.00013. The DNA extraction yield percentage for QIagen, dipstick, NaOH, magnetic beads, and direct dipstick ranged from 0.047 ± 0.0388 to 0.475 ± 0.0357. For estuarine waters, which are challenging for eDNA studies due to high turbidity, variable salinity, and the presence of PCR inhibitors, we found that a protocol combining glass filters, magnetic beads, and an extra step for PCR inhibitor removal, is the method that best balances time, cost, and yield. In addition, we provide a generalized decision tree for determining the optimal eDNA protocol for other studies in aquatic systems. Our findings should be applicable to most aquatic environments and provide a clear guide for determining which eDNA protocol should be used under different study constraints. © 2020 Sanches, Schreier.

Turbidity is a parameter related to suspended particle load that it is easy and quick to measure and it is also included in some guidelines for reusing effluents in irrigation. Currently, there are not sufficiently accurate models available to predict outlet turbidity for sand filters, which would be useful for both irrigators and engineers. The aim of this study was to obtain a predictive model able to perform an early detection of the sand filter outlet value of turbidity. This study presents a powerful and effective Bayesian nonparametric approach, termed Gaussian process regression (GPR) model, for predicting the output turbidity (Turbo) from data corresponding to 637 samples of different sand filters using reclaimed effluent. This optimization technique involves kernel parameter setting in the GPR training procedure, which significantly influences the regression accuracy. To this end, the most important parameters of this process are monitored and analyzed: type of filter, height of the filter bed (H), filtration velocity (v) and filter inlet values of the electrical conductivity (CEi), dissolved oxygen (DOi), pHi, turbidity (Turbi) and water temperature (Ti). The results of the present study are two-fold. In the first place, the significance of each variable on the filtration is presented through the model. Secondly, a model for forecasting the outlet turbidity was obtained with success. Indeed, regression with optimal hyperparameters was performed and a coefficient of determination equal to 0.8921 for outlet turbidity was obtained when this new predictive GPR–based model was applied to the experimental dataset. The agreement between experimental data and the model confirmed the good performance of the latter. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bayesian statistics; Clogging; Drip irrigation; Gaussian process regression (GPR); Machine learning techniques","Dissolved oxygen; Effluents; Forecasting; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Irrigation; Regression analysis; Sand; Turbidity; Water filtration; Bayesian statistics; Clogging; Drip irrigation; Gaussian process regression; Machine learning techniques; Learning systems; Bayesian analysis; dissolved oxygen; drip irrigation; effluent; electrical conductivity; filter; Gaussian method; machine learning; turbidity; water temperature",,,,,"AGL2015-63750-R, RTI2018-094798-B-100","Authors wish to acknowledge the computational support provided by the Department of Mathematics at University of Oviedo as well as financial support of the Spanish Research Agency through grants AGL2015-63750-R and RTI2018-094798-B-100 .

An unprecedented eutrophication crisis in 2016 and 2019 with abrupt changes in the quality of its waters caused a great social alarm. Understanding and modeling the level of a eutrophication indicator, such as chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), benefits the management of this complex system. In this study, we investigate the potential machine learning (ML) methods to predict the level of Chl-a. Particularly, Multilayer Neural Networks (MLNNs) and Support Vector Regressions (SVRs) are evaluated using as a target dataset information of up to nine different water quality parameters. The most relevant input combinations were extracted using wrapper feature selection methods which simplified the structure of the model, resulting in a more accurate and efficient procedure. Although the performance in the validation phase showed that SVR models obtained better results than MLNNs, experimental results indicated that both ML algorithms provide satisfactory results in the prediction of Chl-a concentration, reaching up to 0.7 R2CV (cross-validated coefficient of determination) for the best-fit models. © 2020 by the authors.

The current research develops an emerging evolutionary data-intelligence model: extreme learning machine (ELM) integrated with kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) to predict the performance of the Tamburawa WTP in Kano, Nigeria. A traditional feed-forward neural network (FFNN) and a classical linear autoregressive (AR) models were also employed to compare the predictive performance. For this purpose, different input data with the corresponding treated pH, turbidity, total dissolve solids, and hardness as the target variables obtained from the WTP were used. The predictive models are evaluated based on the three numerical indices, namely Nash-Sutcliffe (NC), root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). To examine the similarities and differences between the observed and predicted values, a two-dimension graphical diagram (i.e., Taylor diagram) was also utilized. The predictive results revealed the potential of KPCA-ELM, which exhibited a high level of accuracy in comparison to the single models for all the considered variables with a slight exception in terms of pH prediction. Two different model combination were built for each single (FFNN, ELM, and AR) model and KPCA algorithms (KPCA-FFNN, KPCA-ELM, and KPCA-AR). The results also depicted that both ELM and FFNN models demonstrated prediction skill and therefore, can serve as reliable models. The outcomes may contribute to the aforementioned modeling of the treated parameters and provides a reference benchmark for wastewater management and control in the Tamburawa WTP. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cross-validation; Data-driven algorithms; Extreme learning marchine; Kano-Tamburawa; Principal component analysis; Water treatment plant",,,,,,,"The authors wish to thank the staff of the Tamburawa Water Treatment Plant, Kano (Nigeria) for supplying the available data used to conduct this research.",,,,,,,,,,"WHO and Unicef, Progress on sanitation and drinking water 2013 update (2013) World Health, 1 (October), pp. 1-40; Maryam, B., Büyükgüngör, H., Wastewater reclamation and reuse trends in Turkey: opportunities and challenges (2019) J.

With the exponential growth of the human population, the need for conservation of water resources is gaining greater importance. Many water management systems have been proposed in the past using different technologies to address the issue which are high in cost and energy consumption. With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), the pursuit of the smart water management system is gaining momentum. This study first discusses the architecture and various components of IoT based water management system in detail followed by in-depth survey of all existing IoT based water management systems. Various measurement parameters such as water level, pH level, turbidity, salinity, etc. used in different water management systems proposed in the literature have also been identified and a comparison of various systems based on these parameters has also been presented. Finally, based on the survey, list of various essential attributes of these systems are framed which must be incorporated in future designs. In addition to this, an architecture of a smart water management system based on IoT and Machine learning has also been proposed as future scope which addresses all these essential attributes and also uses machine learning based predictions which can increase the efficiency of the smart management system. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, three machine learning algorithms were used to predict variations in DOC concentrations in an Australian drinking water catchment as a function of climate, catchment and physical water quality data. Four independent variables including precipitation, temperature, leaf area index and turbidity (n ¼ 5,540) were selected from a large dataset to develop and train each machine learning model. The accuracy of the multivariable linear regression, support vector regression (SVR) and Gaussian process regression algorithms with different kernel functions was determined using adjusted R-squared (adj. R2), root-mean-squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). Model accuracy was very sensitive to the time interval used to average climate observations prior to pairing with DOC observations. The SVR model with a quadratic kernel function and a 12-day time interval between climate and water quality observations outperformed the other machine learning algorithms (adj. R2 ¼ 0.71, RMSE ¼ 1.9, MAE ¼ 1.35). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve method (AUC) confirmed that the SVR model could predict 92% of the elevated DOC observations; however, it was not possible to estimate DOC values at specific sampling sites in the catchment, probably due to the complex local geological and hydrological changes in the sites that directly surround and feed each sampling point. Further research is required to establish potential relationships between climatological data and NOM concentration in other water catchments – especially in the face of a changing climate. © 2021 The Authors.","Climate; Machine learning; Natural organic matter; Water quality",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Arnell, N.

Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used to develop the‎prediction model. Six water quality parameters (dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD),‎chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), and suspended solids (SS)) were predicted. The‎dataset was obtained from the measurement of 14 stations of Kelantan River from September 2005 to December‎2017 with a total sample of 148 monthly data. We defined 3 schemes of prediction to investigate the contribution‎of the attribute number and the model performance. The outcome of the study demonstrated that the prediction‎of the suspended solid parameter gave the best performance, which was indicated by the highest values of the‎R2 score. Meanwhile, the prediction of the COD parameter gave the lowest score of R2 score, indicating the difficulty‎of the dataset to be modelled by SVM. The analysis of the contribution of attribute number shows that the‎prediction of the four parameters (DO, BOD, NH3-N, and SS) is directly proportional to the performance of the‎model. Similarly, the best prediction of the pH parameter is obtained from the utilization of the least number of‎attributes found in scheme 1. © 2020. The American Society of Hematology.

Aquatic biodiversity depends on water quality parameters for survival. Our research focuses on monitoring natural water resources for the management of aquatic biodiversity and water quality. Deep learning with its unique selflearning feature is capable of learning layer by layer and creating a new model for a given dataset. We developed a new semi-supervised framework for predicting and monitoring aquatic life by using a stacked auto-encoder with Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) training. The unlabeled data is learned by stacked autoencoder and labeled data is learned by softmax classifier. The new combined network evaluates the available biodiversity. The simulation and prediction is done by analysis of various water quality parameters (pH, Dissolved Oxygen, Nitrate Content and Turbidity). The new model has better accuracy and less mean squared error for predicting aquatic biodiversity. Results from experiments show that this new framework is robust and accurate with good prospects for practical applications. © 2020, Research Trend. All rights reserved.","Biodiversity.

The ELM-RBF was selected to exploit the computational robustness of ELM and accuracy of RBF for sufficiently large number of data that were available from the plant. The coagulation data were divided into two categories based on low and high turbidity. The optimum number of input parameters for modeling the coagulation of low turbidity water was found to be 3, whereas the optimum number of input parameters for modeling the coagulation of high turbidity water was found to be 4. Re-selection of the number of input parameters was necessary considering that raw water alkalinity was a significant factor in improving the high turbidity model performance. The low turbidity model was capable of predicting the coagulant dosage with correlation coefficient exceeding 0.97. The high turbidity model was capable of predicting the coagulation dosage with reasonably acceptable correlation coefficient of at least 0.80. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial network; Big data analysis; Coagulation; Extreme leaning machine; Radial basis function",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Jiao, R., Fabris, R., Chow, C., Drikas, M., van Leeuwen, J., Wang, D., Roles of coagulant species and mechanisms on floc characteristics and filterability (2016) Chemosphere, 150, pp. 211-218; Bolto, B., Gregory, J., Organic polyelectrolytes in water treatment (2007) Water Res., 41 (11), pp. 2301-2324; Yang, Z., Gao, B., Yue, Q., Coagulation performance and residual aluminum speciation of Al2(SO4)3 and polyaluminum chloride (PAC) in Yellow River water treatment (2010) Chem.

However, these classical methods have limitations, particularly on images where there are many overlapping pixel values between features, which is common in remote sensing images. The advent of machine learning, in particular, deep learning in computer vision and image analysis, has gained interest in the remote sensing field. Current deep learning architecture has been able to achieve high accuracy for image recognition, object detection, and segmentation. This study performed image segmentation on the coastal area with high water turbidity using Landsat-8 images. Currently, the standard tool to derive water turbidity data from Landsat-8 images is the level-2 plugin of SEADAS software. However, due to its rigorous processing method, the processing time using SEADAS Level-2 Plugin is quite long; for example, processing one Landsat-8 image took around 8 hours. As a consequence, the amount of time needed to process multiple images is increasing. Deep learning has advantages once the model trained, the inference or prediction process is quite fast. Therefore it has the potential to be used as a complementary tool to predict and segment high turbidity areas, because in deep learning. In this study, we implemented U-Net architecture with ResNet connection and used Generative-Adversarial Network (GAN) to refined segmentation results. © 2019 IEEE.","CNN; Deep learning; GAN; Image segmentation; Machine learning; Remote sensing","Deep learning; Image recognition; Learning systems; Machine learning; Maximum likelihood; Network architecture; Object detection; Pixels; Processing; Remote sensing; Semantics; Turbidity; Adversarial networks; Complementary tools; Learning architectures; Overlapping pixels; Prediction process; Remote sensing images; Segmentation results; Semantic segmentation; Image segmentation",,,,,"NKB-0514/UN2.R3.1/HKP.05.00/2019; Universitas Indonesia, UI; Direktorat Riset dan Pengabdian Masyarakat, DRPM; Direktorat Riset Dan Pengabdian Kepada Masyarakat, DRPM","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported by funding from University Grant for Internationally Indexed PublicationofStudents’FinalProject(HibahPITTAB) Contract No: NKB-0514/UN2.R3.1/HKP.05.00/2019, administered by the Directorate of Research and Community Engagement (DRPM), Universitas Indonesia.","This work was supported by funding from University Grant for Internationally Indexed Publication of Students' Final Project (Hibah PITTA B) Contract No: NKB-0514/UN2.R3.1/HKP.05.00/2019, administered by the Directorate of Research and Community Engagement (DRPM), Universitas Indonesia.",,,,,,,,,"Worboys, M.F., Duckham, M., (2004) GIS: A Computing Perspective, , Second Edition.

The safety and accessibility of drinking-water are major concerns throughout the globe. Health risks may arise from consumption of water contaminated with infectious agents, toxic chemicals etc. In this paper a system is proposed to check the water quality and warn the user before water gets contaminated.There are different parameters that can contaminate the water. These parameters are taken into account and used for predicting when to clean the water. The system uses technologies such as IoT and Machine Learning. It consist of the physical and chemical sensor to measure pH, turbidity, colour, DO, conductivity etc. to check the parameters.The data obtained from the sensors are recorded in the database and further sent for analysis. The neural network algorithm is used for predicting the result. It is used to obtain non-linear relationship for predicted output. The system sends the alert message to user when any of the parameters are lower than the standard values. This helps the user to know beforehand about the contamination of water in their residential tanks. This technique can not only be limited upto residential tanks but can also be used in water treatment plants and industries. © 2019 IJSTR.","IoT; Machine learning; Neural network; Prediction; Sensors; Storage tanks; Water quality",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Liu, P., Wang, J., Sangaiah, A.K., Xie, Y., Yin, X., Analysis and Prediction of Water Quality Using LSTM Deep Neural Networks in IoT Environment (2019) Sustainability, MDPI, Open Access Journal, 11 (7), pp. 1-14. , April; Gopavanitha, K., Nagaraju, S., A low cost system for real time water quality monitoring and controlling using IoT (2017) IEEE Conference paper, , August; Jha, M.K., Sah, R.K., Rashmitha, M.S., Sinha, R., Sujatha, B.K.V., Suma -Smart Water Monitoring System for Real-Time Water Quality and Usage Monitoring (2018) IEEE Conference paper, , july; Khaili, A.A., Mamari, A.A., Amer, H., Ibrahim, W., (2018) An Affordable System for Remotely Monitoring Water Quality in Residential Water Tanks, , IEEE paper, November; Daigavane, V.V., Gaikwad, M.A., Water Quality Monitoring System Based on IOT (2017) 2017 Advances in Wireless and Mobile Communications, , Nov, ISSN 0973-6972; http://staff.ttu.ee/~jmajak/Neural_networks_basics_.pdf; Thair, S.K., Abdul Hameed, M.J., Ayad, S.M., Prediction of water quality of Euphrates river by using artificial neural network model (2014) International Research Journal of Natural Sciences, 2 (3), pp. 25-38. , September; Koditala, N.K., Pandey, P.S., (2018) Water Quality Monitoring System Using IoT and Machine Learning, , IEEE paper, August; El-Shafie, N.A., Karim, O.A., El-Shafie, A.H., (2013) Application of artificial neural networks for water quality prediction, 22, pp. 187-201. , May; Resources Internet of Things World Forum, , www.iotwf.com/resources/72",,,,"International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research",,,,,22778616,,,,"English","Int.

This is often due to the coexistence of pit latrines with domestic wells in densely populated areas. In this context, developing alternative methodologies to map fecal pollution in shallow wells is needed. A thorough survey of over 240 domestic wells and 570 pit latrines was conducted in a rural town of southern Mali. Water samples were collected from all wells and tested for temperature, pH, electric conductivity, total dissolved solids, turbidity and thermotolerant coliforms. The outcomes of the field survey were incorporated into a GIS database. Thirteen machine leaning classifiers, including different statistical algorithms, instance-based learners and tree-based models, were used to determine the spatial distribution of fecal pollution as per five explanatory variables (latrine density, distance to the closest latrine, borehole yield, water table depth and population density). The best performing classifiers, selected on test scores, were then used to develop predictive maps. Random forest and logistic regression rendered prediction scores for fecal pollution in excess of 0.90. Multilayer perceptrons, support vector machines and quadratic discriminant analyses also proved adept at forecasting fecal pollution. Ensemble mapping shows that 30–50 m buffers around domestic wells may be sufficient to prevent contamination of domestic supplies in most instances. This demonstrates that machine learning may provide a versatile methodological alternative to traditional Darcian approaches. On the other hand, the practical difficulties involved in maintaining wellhead protection areas suggests the need to implement piped water supplies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Big data; Contamination; Domestic well; Latrine; Machine learning; Supervised classification","Big data; Contamination; Decision trees; Discriminant analysis; Groundwater; Learning systems; Machine learning; Mapping; Population statistics; Rural areas; Supervised learning; Support vector machines; Surveys; Water supply; Domestic wells; Explanatory variables; Latrine; Quadratic discriminant analysis; Statistical algorithm; Supervised classification; Total dissolved solids; Wellhead protection areas; Groundwater pollution; artificial intelligence; feces; GIS; groundwater pollution; machine learning; pollution incidence; rural area; supervised classification; well water",,,,,"2016/ACDE/1953, 2018/ACDE/0799, RTI2018-099394-B-I00; Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, MCIU","This research has been funded by the Agencia Española de Cooperación al Desarrollo (AECID), under grant numbers 2016/ACDE/1953 and 2018/ACDE/0799 and grant number RTI2018-099394-B-I00 of the Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades .

For the purpose of disaster prevention and mitigation, it is very important to monitor floating macroalgae blooms using satellite imagery. The traditional macroalgae remote sensing detection methods based on the vegetation indices are very sensitive to the threshold value which is affected by many factors in the complex atmospheric-oceanic environment. The threshold has obvious temporal and spatial variations, and is difficult to determine accurately. The expert experience is required to assist the value of threshold which leads to the low automation of detection. Aiming at this problem, this study introduces an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) into the field of macroalgae remote sensing detection. Taking the four-bands GF-1 WFV optical images with 16-m resolution as an example, an automatic remote sensing detection model of macroalgae is constructed. The evaluation based on independent data shows that the accuarcy of this method is up to 86 %. The method is not disturbed by thin clouds, sun glint, high-turbidity water, and other factors. In addition, no manual intervention is required which suggests that the proposed method has strong potential of automated detection for the floating macroalgae blooms. © Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2019.","Automatic detection; extreme learning machine; GF-1; macroalgae",,,,,,"32405, PI-2017-3; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 41476159, 41506203, 61890964","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 41476159, Grant 41506203, Grant 61890964, and the China-Korea Joint Ocean Research Center under Grant PI-2017-3.

The collection of diatoms and measurements of water quality and land-use were performed every May between 2009 and 2016, with no influence from the Asian monsoon and snow. Throughout the study, 564 diatoms were classified with first and second dominant species of Nitzschia inconspicua and N. perminuta. Based on diatom appearance and standing crops, the 512 sampling stations were divided into four groups by cluster analysis, and two regions, namely the West and East Sea. Geographically, G1, G2, G3, and G4 were located in the East Sea, Southeast Sea, West Sea, and Southwest Sea, respectively. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) results indicated that environmental factors, such as turbidity, electric conductivity (EC), and total phosphorus (TP), significantly influenced the distribution of epilithic diatoms. A random forest model showed that major environmental factors influencing the diatom species appearance included EC, salinity, turbidity, and total nitrogen. This study demonstrated that the spatial distribution of epilithic diatoms in the southern estuaries of the Korean Peninsula was determined by several factors, including a geographically higher tidal current-driven turbidity increase and higher industrial or anthropogenic nutrient-loading. © 2019 by the authors.

This system includes a lot of human efforts, money and time which was not suitable for performing this task. There was a need of a system which can collect data then analyze that data and generate results in real time. In this paper we are focusing on creating a low-cost smart device which can be used to monitoring water quality at different places. We focus of creating a device with Arduino along with some sensors and modules to collect data of water quality at different places. This device will be connected to internet with the help of a Wi-Fi module and it will send all data on a server to record values. At the same time, we are using Artificial Neural Network for the analysis of this data for generating high accuracy results, after this the corresponding authorities will be notified to take actions accordingly. This device will be able to check and calculate some most important factors of water quality like EC, pH, Dissolved Oxygen, Color and Turbidity to check the quality of the water and these values will be send to the server so that an authorized person can check that data for any use. This data will be available to be viewed either in the form of a graph or in a table with numeric values. The device will also be able to give alert based on values which it has calculated and along with this we will be using Artificial Neural Network to analyze this data which will help in treatment process. © 2019 IEEE.","Artificial Neural Network; Cloud computing; Internet of things; Machine Learning; Sensors; WEB App","Biochemical oxygen demand; Cloud computing; Data acquisition; Dissolved oxygen; Intelligent computing; Learning systems; Neural networks; Sensors; Waste treatment; Wastewater treatment; Water quality; Water treatment; High-accuracy; Input and outputs; Monitoring water quality; Numeric values; Quality of water; Record values; Treatment process; Web App; Internet of things",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Danrong, Z., Xiaohui, G., Guan, Y., Xinfang, C., Lei, Z., Prediction of water quality of xianlin reservoir affected by engineering measures (2011) 2011 International Symposium on Water Resource and Environmental Protection, 2, pp. 1070-1073. , May IEEE; Cui, Y., Qu, J., Yang, A., Chang, J., Li, B., Computer simulation of the grey system prediction method and its application in water quality prediction (2009) 2009 International Conference on Test and Measurement, 1, pp. 323-326. , December IEEE; Wu, W., Zhang, K., Yin, J., Notice of retraction study on water quality information decision support system (2010) 2010 2nd International Conference on Electronic Computer Technology, pp. 197-199. , May).

The main objective is to build a system that regularly monitors the water quality and manages the sustainability. This system deals with specific standards like low cost background and system efficiency when compared to other studies. In this paper, IoT based real time monitoring of water quality system is implemented along with Machine learning techniques such as J48, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Random Forest. These machine learning techniques are compared based on the hyper-parameters and the results were obtained. The attributes such as pH, Dissolved Oxygen (DO), turbidity, conductivity obtained from the corresponding sensors are used to create a prediction model which classifies the quality of water. Measurement of water quality and reporting system is implemented by using Arduino controller, GSM/GPRS module for gathering data in real time. The collected data are then analyzed using WEKA interface which is a visualization tool used for the analysis of data and prediction modeling. The Random forest technique outperforms J48 and Multilayer perceptron by giving 98.89% of correctly classified instances. © BEIESP.","Internet of Things (IoT); Machine learning techniques; Random forest; Water quality; WEKA",,,,,,"Department of Science and Technology, Government of West Bengal, DST: SR/FST/ETI-371/2014; SASTRA University","The authors are grateful to the Department of Science & Technology, New Delhi, India (SR/FST/ETI-371/2014).

Sensitive and rapid markers for ecosystem stress are urgently needed to underpin effective management and restoration strategies. Although the fundamental contribution of microbes to the stability and functioning of coral reefs is widely recognised, it remains unclear how different reef microbiomes respond to environmental perturbations and whether microbiomes are sensitive enough to predict environmental anomalies that can lead to ecosystem stress. However, the lack of coral reef microbial baselines hinders our ability to study the link between shifts in microbiomes and ecosystem stress. In this study, we established a comprehensive microbial reference database for selected Great Barrier Reef sites to assess the diagnostic value of multiple free-living and host-associated reef microbiomes to infer the environmental state of coral reef ecosystems. Results: A comprehensive microbial reference database, originating from multiple coral reef microbiomes (i.e. seawater, sediment, corals, sponges and macroalgae), was generated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing for 381 samples collected over the course of 16 months. By coupling this database to environmental parameters, we showed that the seawater microbiome has the greatest diagnostic value to infer shifts in the surrounding reef environment. In fact, 56% of the observed compositional variation in the microbiome was explained by environmental parameters, and temporal successions in the seawater microbiome were characterised by uniform community assembly patterns. Host-associated microbiomes, in contrast, were five-times less responsive to the environment and their community assembly patterns were generally less uniform. By applying a suite of indicator value and machine learning approaches, we further showed that seawater microbial community data provide an accurate prediction of temperature and eutrophication state (i.e. chlorophyll concentration and turbidity). Conclusion: Our results reveal that free-living microbial communities have a high potential to infer environmental parameters due to their environmental sensitivity and predictability. This highlights the diagnostic value of microorganisms and illustrates how long-term coral reef monitoring initiatives could be enhanced by incorporating assessments of microbial communities in seawater. We therefore recommend timely integration of microbial sampling into current coral reef monitoring initiatives. © 2019 The Author(s).","Coral reef; Coral reef microbiomes; Machine learning; Microbial baselines; Microbial indicators; Microbial monitoring","chlorophyll; chlorophyll a; environmental marker; RNA 16S; sea water; RNA 16S; aquatic environment; Article; Betaproteobacteria; biofilm; chlorophyll content; clinical indicator; coral reef; diagnostic value; DNA extraction; ecosystem monitoring; environmental factor; environmental parameters; environmental sensitivity; eutrophication; gene sequence; habitat; host range; machine learning; macroalga; microbial community; microbial diversity; microbial indicator; microbiome; nitrogen concentration; nonhuman; Planctomycetes; priority journal; Prochlorococcus; Proteobacteria; random forest; sea surface temperature; seasonal variation; sediment; temperature sensitivity; total organic carbon; turbidity; animal; Anthozoa; Australia; bacterium; biodiversity; classification; environmental monitoring; microbiology; microflora; Animals; Anthozoa; Australia; Bacteria; Biodiversity; Coral Reefs; Environmental Monitoring; Microbiota; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Seawater",,"chlorophyll, 1406-65-1, 15611-43-5; chlorophyll a, 479-61-8; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S",,,,"We would like to acknowledge the contribution of the Marine Microbes (MM) and Biomes of Australian Soil Environments (BASE) projects, through the Australian Microbiome Initiative in the generation of data used in this publication.

E. coli concentrations are affected by water quality parameters that co-vary with E. coli concentrations and may be easily measured with currently available sensors. The objective of this work was to identify the most influential environmental covariates affecting E. coli concentrations during a three-month biweekly monitoring period within two irrigation ponds in Maryland during the summer of 2017. E. coli levels as well as sensor-based water quality parameters including turbidity, pH, dissolved oxygen, dissolved fluorescent organic matter, conductivity, and chlorophyll were measured at 23 and 34 locations in ponds 1 and 2, respectively. Regression tree analyses were used to determine the most influential water quality parameters for the prediction of E. coli levels. Correlations between E. coli and water quality covariates were not strong and were inconsistently significant. Shoreline sample locations had higher E. coli concentrations than interior pond samples and significant differences were observed when comparing these two groups. Regression trees provided fairly accurate predictions of E. coli levels based on water quality parameters with R 2 values ranging from 0.70 to 0.93. Factors identified via the regression trees varied by sampling date but common leading covariates included cyanobacteria, organic matter, and turbidity. Results indicated environmental covariates, sensed either remotely or in situ, could be useful to delineate areas with different E. coli survival conditions across irrigation ponds and potentially other water bodies such as lakes, rivers, or bays. © 2019","E. coli; Indicator bacteria; Irrigation water; Regression tree; Water quality","Biochemical oxygen demand; Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Dissolved oxygen; Forestry; Irrigation; Lakes; Organic compounds; Ponds; Regression analysis; Reservoirs (water); Turbidity; Water quality; Accurate prediction; E. coli; Indicator bacteria; Intraseasonal variations; Irrigation waters; Regression trees; Survival conditions; Water quality parameters; Escherichia coli; chlorophyll; dissolved oxygen; organic matter; coliform bacterium; concentration (composition); correlation; irrigation; machine learning; seasonal variation; sensor; water quality; Article; bacterial survival; bay; concentration (parameter); conductance; correlational study; cyanobacterium; environmental factor; environmental monitoring; Escherichia coli; irrigation (agriculture); lake; Maryland; nonhuman; pH; pond; precipitation; prediction; priority journal; river; seasonal variation; summer; turbidity; water quality; environmental monitoring; Escherichia coli; growth, development and aging; microbiology; pond; season; Maryland; United States; Cyanobacteria; Agricultural Irrigation; Environmental Monitoring; Escherichia coli; Maryland; Ponds; Seasons; Water Microbiology",,"chlorophyll, 1406-65-1, 15611-43-5",,,"U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA: 8042-12630-011-00D","This work was supported through the USDA 's Agricultural Research Service project number 8042-12630-011-00D .","Authors appreciate the help of USDA technicians B.

That is particularly critical when human divers work in close collaboration with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). In absence of global positioning signals underwater, acoustic based sensors such as LBL (long-baseline), SBL (short-baseline) and USBL (ultrashort-baseline) are commonly used for navigation and localization. In addition to these low-bandwidth and high latency technologies, cameras and sonars can provide position measurements relative to the vehicle which can be used as an aid for navigation as well as for keeping a safe working distance between the diver and the AUV. While optical cameras are highly affected by water turbidity and lighting conditions, sonar images often become hard to interpret using conventional image processing methods due to image granulation and high noise levels. This paper focuses on finding a robust and reliable sonar image processing method for detection and tracking of human divers using convolutional neural networks. Machine learning algorithms are making a huge impact in computer vision applications but are not always considered when it comes to sonar image processing. After presenting commonly used image processing techniques the paper will focus on giving an overview of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and explore their performance in custom sonar image dataset processing. Finally, the performance of these algorithms will be compared on a set of sonar recordings to determine their reliability and applicability in a real-time operation. © 2019 IEEE.","Convolutional neural networks; diver detection; object detection; sonar image processing","Autonomous underwater vehicles; Cameras; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Navigation; Network architecture; Oceanography; Optical data processing; Processing; Sonar; Underwater acoustic communication; Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs); Computer vision applications; Detection and tracking; Image processing - methods; Image processing technique; Real-time operation; Ultra-short baselines; Underwater navigation; Image processing",,,,,"N00014-18-1-2011; Office of Naval Research, ONR; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 731103; European Commission, EC; Hrvatska Zaklada za Znanost, HRZZ: IP-2016-06-2082; European Social Fund, ESF","This research is sponsored by the Croatian Science Foundation MultiYear Project under G.

The essential characteristics of water pollutants can be described by water quality indices (WQIs). Hence, a ferocious demand for obtaining an accurate prediction of WQIs is of high importance for perception of pollutant patterns in natural streams. Field studies conducted on different rivers indicated that there is no general relationship to yield water quality parameters with a permissible level of accuracy. Over the past decades, several artificial intelligence (AI) models have been employed to predict more precise estimation of WQIs rather than conventional models. In this way, through the current study, multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) and least square-support vector machine (LS-SVM), as machine learning methods, were used to predict indices of the five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). To improve the proposed approaches, 200 series of field data, collected from Karoun River southwest of Iran, pertain to the nine independent input parameters, namely electrical conductivity (EC), sodium (Na+), calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), orthophosphate (PO43−), nitrite (NO2−), nitrate nitrogen (NO3−), turbidity, and pH. The performances of the LS-SVM and MARS techniques were quantified in both training and testing stages by means of several statistical parameters. Furthermore, the results of the proposed AI models were compared with those obtained using artificial neural network (ANN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and multiple regression equations. Results of the present research work indicated that the proposed artificial intelligence techniques, as machine learning classifiers, were found to be efficient in order to predict water quality parameters. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Least square-support vector machine;

Cross-connection events can result in serious health concerns and reduce public confidence in reclaimed water. Thus, reliable, cost-effective and real-time online detection methods for early warning are required. The current study carried out pilot-scale experiments to simulate potable-reclaimed water pipe cross-connection events for different mixing ratios (from 30% to 1%) using machine learning methods based on multiple conventional water quality parameters. The parameters included residual chlorine, pH, turbidity, temperature, conductivity, oxidation-reduction potential and chemical oxygen demand. The results showed that correlated variation occurred among water quality parameters at the time of the cross-connection event. A single parameter-based method can be effective at high mixing ratios, but not at low mixing ratios. The direct supporting vector machine (SVM)-based method managed to overcome this drawback, but coped poorly with abnormal readings of water parameter sensors. In that respect, a Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC)-SVM-based method was developed. It provided not only high detection performance under normal conditions, but also remained reliable when abnormal readings occurred. The detection accuracy and true positive rate of this method was still over 88%, and the false positive rate was below 12%, given a sudden variation of an individual water quality parameter. The receiver operating characteristic curves further confirmed the promising practical applicability of this PCC-SVM-based method for early detection of cross-connection events. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cross-connection; Machine learning method; Potable water; Real-time detection; Water quality parameter; Water reuse","chlorine; drinking water; detection method; drinking water; physicochemical property; real time; sensor; water quality; Article; chemical oxygen demand; conductance; cost effectiveness analysis; data processing; false positive result; municipal wastewater; oxidation reduction potential; pH; standardization; supervised machine learning; turbidity; water quality; water supply; water temperature; waste water; water pipe smoking; water quality; water supply; Drinking Water; Waste Water; Water Pipe Smoking; Water Quality; Water Supply",,"chlorine, 13981-72-1, 7782-50-5; Drinking Water; Waste Water",,,"2016YFE0118800; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation: 2018M631495","We are grateful for the support of the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2018M631495 ) and the National Key Research and Development Program of China for International Science & Innovation Cooperation Major Project between Governments ( 2016YFE0118800 ).",,,,,,,,,,"Ahmad, A., Hassan, M., Abdullah, M., Rahman, H., Hussin, F., Abdullah, H., Saidur, R., A review on applications of ANN and SVM for building electrical energy consumption forecasting (2014) Renew.

We introduce the application of canonical correlation analysis fusion as a method for water-based spectral analysis to overcome the low signal-to-noise ratio of the data. Water-quality variables and spectral reflectance were used to create predictive models via machine learning regression models, including multiple linear regression, partial least-squares regression, Gaussian process regression, support vector machine regression, and extreme learning machine regression. The models were then combined using decision-level fusion. Results indicate that canonical correlation analysis feature-level fusion and machine learning techniques are superior to traditional methods. © 2019 American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.",,"Algae; Correlation methods; Least squares approximations; Linear regression; Machine learning; Reflection; Remote sensing; Signal to noise ratio; Spectrum analysis; Support vector machines; Water quality; Canonical correlation analysis; Gaussian process regression; Low signal-to-noise ratio; Machine learning techniques; Multiple linear regressions; Partial least squares regression; Support vector machine regressions; Water quality parameters; Quality control; chlorophyll a; cyanobacterium; dissolved load; machine learning; prediction; regression analysis; remote sensing; spectral reflectance; suspended load; turbidity; water quality; Chlorophyta",,,,,"Saint Louis University, SLU; Nature Conservancy, TNC: 061716-01","This study was made possible by funding from the Saint Louis University President’s Research Fund, The Nature Conservancy (Award Number 061716-01), and the National Great Rivers Research and Education Center (NGRREC).

While turbidity itself does not directly present a hazard to human health, it can be an indication of poor water quality and mask the presence of parasites such as Cryptosporidium. It is, therefore, a recommendation of the World Health Organisation (WHO) that turbidity should not exceed a level of 1 Nephelometric Turbidity Unit (NTU) before chlorination. For a drinking water supplier, turbidity peaks can be highly disruptive requiring the temporary shutdown of a water treatment works. Such events must be carefully managed to ensure continued supply; to recover the supply deficit, water stores must be depleted or alternative works utilised. Machine learning techniques have been shown to be effective for the modelling of complex environmental systems, often used to help shape environmental policy. We contribute to the literature by adopting such techniques for operational purposes, developing a decision support tool that predicts >1 NTU turbidity events up to seven days in advance allowing water supply managers to make proactive interventions. We apply a Generalised Linear Model (GLM) and a Random Forest (RF) model for the prediction of >1 NTU events. AUROC scores of over 0.80 at five of six sites suggest that machine learning techniques are suitable for predicting turbidity peaking events. Furthermore, we find that the RF model can provide a modest performance boost due to its stronger capacity to capture nonlinear interactions in the data. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Analytics; Turbidity prediction; Water quality","Decision support systems; Decision trees; Environmental protection; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Potable water; Turbidity; Water quality; Water supply; Analytics; Complex environmental systems; Decision support tools; Generalised linear models; Machine learning techniques; Nephelometric turbidity units; Nonlinear interactions; Water treatment works; Water treatment",,,,,"Alan Turing Institute; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC: EP/N510129/1; Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: ES/P000673/1","This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council [grant number ES/P000673/1 ]; and The Alan Turing Institute under the EPSRC [grant number EP/N510129/1 ].",,,,,,,,,,"Twort, A.C., Law, F.M., Crowley, F.W., Ratnayaka, D.D., Water Supply (1994), 4 ed.

Nevertheless, existing knowledge of the role that wet deposition plays in biogeochemical cycles of volatile species remains insufficient, and this topic requires more scientific effort to be explored and understood. In this study, we employed the eXtreme Gradient Boosting tree ensemble for revealing TEX transfer from ambient air to rainwater, and applied a novel SHapley Additive exPlanations feature attribution framework to examine the relevance of the monitored parameters and identify key factors that govern wet deposition of TEX.

In particular, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) maintains a massive suite of sensors throughout the nation's waterways that are used to inform such decisions, with all data made available to the public. However, the corresponding measurements are regularly corrupted due to sensor faults, fouling, and decalibration, and hence USGS scientists are forced to spend costly time and resources manually examining data to look for anomalies. We present a method of automatically detecting such events using supervised machine learning. We first present an extensive study of which water quality parameters can be reliably predicted, using support vector machines and gradient boosting algorithms for regression. We then show that the trained predictors can be used to automatically detect sensor decalibration, providing a system that could be easily deployed by the USGS to reduce the resources needed to maintain data fidelity. © 2018 IEEE.","gradient boosting; supervised learning; support vector regression; water quality","Big data; Dissolved oxygen; Fault detection; Machine learning; Supervised learning; Water quality; Data fidelity; Gradient boosting; Policy decisions; Supervised learning approaches; Supervised machine learning; Support vector regression (SVR); United states geological surveys; Water quality parameters; Biochemical oxygen demand",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Basak, D., Pal, S., Patranabis, D.C., Support vector regression (2007) Neural Information Processing-Letters and Reviews, 11 (10), pp. 203-224; Chen, T., Guestrin, C., Xgboost: A scalable tree boosting system (2016) Proceedings of the 22nd ACM Sigkdd International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 785-794. , ACM; Pedregosa, F., Varoquaux, G., Gramfort, A., Michel, V., Thirion, B., Grisel, O., Blondel, M., Dubourg, V., Scikit-learn: Machine learning in python (2011) Journal of machine learning research, 12, pp. 2825-2830. , Oct; Fernández-Delgado, M., Cernadas, E., Barro, S., Amorim, D., Do we need hundreds of classifiers to solve real world classification problems (2014) J.

Raya Jakarta-Bogor Km. 46, Cibinong, Bogor, 16911, Indonesia","Satellite imagery along with image processing techniques are essential tools for bathymetry retrieval since they are relatively inexpensive in term of time and budget in comparison to the conventional bathymetry survey. Approximately, 1126 bathymetric maps in various scales were produced by Badan Informasi Geospasial (BIG) covering Indonesia's oceans and coastal waters. Those maps actually only cover 24,9% of total maps required to cover all Indonesia waters. Moreover, gaps in survey data, particularly in shallow water area, are also problematic. Only 12% of Indonesia's waters are covered by a detailed survey. Hence, BIG is exploring remote sensing techniques to help with the improvement of Indonesia's bathymetric maps including Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB). SDB is promising due to its ability to fill the gap of depths derived from conventional hydrographic surveys. This is important for BIG since achieving wide-area depth coverage via the hydrographic surveys is costly in terms of time and money including for the safety of surveyors. This paper focuses on modelling bathymetry from multispectral images along Tanjung Kelayang, Tanjung Priok and Cilamaya shallow water area, Indonesia. A nonlinear machine learning technique was used to derive shallow water bathymetry by combining single beam echosounding measurements and the reflectance of red, green, blue, and near infrared bands of remotely sensed imagery. SVM can work better in a clear water area, for i.e. Tanjung Kelayang with RMSE less than 0.6. Furthermore, higher accuracies were obtained at depth range 0-5 m and 10-15 m for Tanjung Kelayang and Tanjung Priok, respectively. Highest accuracy was given in the depth range 0-5 m when applying SVM using four bands, but when using only three bands lowest RMSE value was obtained in the depth range of 5-10 m. SVM are able to estimate depth information in the shallow water area, especially in the water depth of <6 m (for i.e., Tanjung Kelayang and Cilamaya). However, the SDB results are noisy in the deeper water area >6 m. The inclusion of NIR band to the datasets results in a better accuracy. From results, we can see a correlation between the accuracy of bathymetric model and water clarity. High turbidity impacted the sensitivity of the depth algorithm. A complete data set containing water quality and benthic data is needed for further analysis to determine specific source of error. © 2019 SPIE.","Bathymetry; Cilamaya; Depth; SDB; Shallow water; Tanjung Kelayang; Tanjung Priok","Bathymetry; Budget control; Image processing; Infrared devices; Learning systems; Maps; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Support vector machines; Water quality; Cilamaya; Depth; Shallow waters; Tanjung Kelayang; Tanjung Priok; Hydrographic surveys",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wahyuningrum, P.I., Jaya, I., Simbolon, D., Algoritma untuk estimasi kedalaman perairan dangkal menggunakan data landsat-7 etm+ (studi kasus: Perairan gugus pulau pari, kepulauan seribu, Jakarta) (2008) Buletin PSP., 17 (3), pp. 333-340; Gao, J., Bathymetric mapping by means of remote sensing: Methods, accuracy and limitations (2009) Progress in Physical Geography: Earth and Environment., 33 (1), pp. 103-116; Lyzenga, D.R., Remote sensing of bottom reflectance and water attenuation parameters in shallow water using aircraft and Landsat data (Bahamas) (1981) International Journal of Remote Sensing., 2 (1), pp. 71-82; Lyzenga, D.R., Passive remote sensing techniques for mapping water depth and bottom features (1978) Applied Optics., 17 (3), pp. 379-383; Spitzer, D., Dirks, R.W.J., Bottom influence on the reflectance of the sea (1987) International Journal of Remote Sensing., 8 (3), pp. 279-308; Van Hengel, W., Spitzer, D., Multi-temporal water depth mapping by means of Landsat TM (1991) International Journal of Remote Sensing., 12 (4), pp. 703-712; Leu, L.-G., Chang, H.-W., Remotely sensing in detecting the water depths and bed load of shallow waters and their changes (2005) Ocean Engineering., 32 (10), pp. 1174-1198; Guzinski, R., Exploring the utility of bathymetry maps derived with multispectral satellite observations in the field of underwater archaeology (2016) Open Archaeology; Pope, R.M., Fry, E.S., Absorption spectrum (380-700 nm) of pure water II Integrating cavity measurements (1997) Applied Optics., 36 (33), p. 8710; Arya, W.G., Santoso, A.I., Evaluasi akurasi ekstraksi kedalaman laut dengan metode lyzenga dan modifikasinya menggunakan data spot-7 di teluk belangbelang mamuju (2016) Geomatika Volume., 22 (1), pp. 09-20; (2019) Tanjung Kelayang-Bangka Belitung, , http://pusriskel.litbang.kkp.go.id/index.php/en/data/riset-wisata-bahari/category/486-tanjung-kelayang-bangkabelitung, Puriskel-KKP.

In addition, the STREAMWISE control system has sensors placed on site to measure and record live data for TSS, turbidity, pH, temperature and the flow of the inlet and outlet wastewater streams. The choice to deploy STREAMWISE at any given site is affected by the confidence in its ability to substantially improve existing performance. First-principles simulation is conducted when data is gathered from the field and the laboratory to predict the improvement in performance due to STREAMWISE. This simulation includes the machine learning algorithms employed by STREAMWISE and uses them to predict the responses to the expected wastewater fluctuations and wastewater characteristics for a given site. Three case studies are presented for different food and beverage industrial sites detailing results from the simulator and direct comparisons to site trials. The case studies include the prediction of improved DAF performance due to STREAMWISE and two instances of parameter sweep functions. The three case studies show the successful predictive ability of the simulator and high accuracy when compared to the site trials. The simulation provides an additional benefit to the STREAMWISE control system and adds to the ability to continuously improve the TCO for customers.

In order to ensure good water quality and establish framework for their protection European Parliament was adopted the Water Framework Directive (WFD) (Directive 2000/60/EC). The biological, hydro morphological and physic chemical quality parameters which are relevant for assessment of ecological status of water body are defined in Annex V of WFD. Traditionally, quality of surface water bodies are monitored by in situ measurements resulting in low spatial and temporal resolution of historical data. Remote sensing has great potential for monitoring and identification of water bodies over large scale regions in a more effective and efficient manner. In order to provide reliable monitoring of water quality, surface reflection derived by multispectral sensors need to be integrated with in situ measurements. Relationship between remote sensing and in situ data is usually modeled by using empirical, machine learning or deep learning algorithms. In this study, a 4-year (2013-2016) result of in situ monitoring of surface water bodies in Serbia are used for calibration and validation of algorithm for water quality monitoring based on Landsat 8 satellite image. The Turbidity, Suspending Sediments, Total Phosphorus and Total Nitrogen (physic chemical parameters) in region of Vojvodina, Republic of Serbia are monitored. The Neuron Networks and Supported Vector Machine are used to analyzing correlation between in situ measurements and Landsat 8 atmospherically corrected satellite images.

In order to develop models, on-line data measured at five-minute time intervals were collected through one year (2007-2008) from the online-monitoring stations which were built near the River Yeşilırmak in Amasya in North-Eastern Turkey. These stations were the first practice in Turkey. Twelve parameters as luminescent dissolved oxygen (LDO), pH, conductivity, nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N), total organic carbon (TOC), chloride, orthophosphate, temperature, turbidity, suspended solid and flow rate were measured at the on-line monitoring stations. To predict the total organic carbon, four input variables, pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen and temperature were selected. Moreover, the data were also collected at the central office in Ankara via a General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) channel. The validity of models was tested by using statistical methods in MATLAB including correlation coefficients (R), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE%) and root mean square error (RMSE). The best result was obtained in the presence of KELM with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel. Rtest = 0.984, MAPEtest = 3.01, RMSEtest = 0.9676. Additionally, Rtrain = 0.995, MAPEtrain = 1.58 and RMSEtrain = 0.532. Among the other two algorithms ANN provided better results than ELM and PLSR. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial Neural Network; Extreme Learning Machine; On-line monitoring; River water quality",,,,,,"105G002","This study was supported by TUBITAK (Project Number: 105G002).",,,,,,,,,,"Csabragi, A., Molnar, S., Tanos, P., Kovacs, J., Application of Artificial Neural Networks to the Forecasting of Dissolved Oxygen Content in Hungarian Section of the River Danube (2017) Ecological Engineering, 100, pp. 63-72; Olyaie, E., Abyaneh, H.Z., Mehr, A.D., A Comparative Analysis among Computational Intelligence Techniques for Dissolved Oxygen Prediction in Delaware River (2017) Geoscience Frontiers, 8 (3), pp. 517-527; Huang, G.B., Zhu, Q.Y., Siew, C.K., Extreme Learning Machine: Theory and Applications (2006) Neurocomputing, 70 (1-3), pp. 489-501; Ding, S., Xu, X., Nie, R., Extreme Learning Machine and applications (2014) Neurocomputing and Applications, 25 (3-4), pp. 549-556; Heddam, S., Kisi, O., Extreme Learning Machines: A New Approach for Modeling Dissolved Oxygen (DO) Concentration with and without Water Quality Variables as Predictors (2017) Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 24 (20), pp. 16702-16724",,,,"Elsevier B.V.",,,,,15707946,,,,"English","Comput.

It is not feasible to monitor recreational waters for all pathogens; therefore, monitoring programs use fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), such as enterococci, to identify wastewater pollution. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used to predict when culturable enterococci concentrations exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Recreational Water Quality Criteria (RWQC) at Escambron Beach, San Juan, Puerto Rico. Ten years of culturable enterococci data were analyzed together with satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST), direct normal irradiance (DNI), turbidity, and dew point, along with local observations of precipitation and mean sea level (MSL). The factors identified as the most relevant for enterococci exceedance predictions based on the U.S. EPA RWQC were DNI, turbidity, cumulative 48 h precipitation, MSL, and SST; they predicted culturable enterococci exceedances with an accuracy of 75% and power greater than 60% based on the Receiving Operating Characteristic curve and F-Measure metrics. Results show the applicability of satellite-derived data and ANNs to predict recreational water quality at Escambron Beach. Future work should incorporate local sanitary survey data to predict risky recreational water conditions and protect human health. © IWA Publishing 2019","Bathing water quality; Enterococci; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Water quality prediction","water; accuracy assessment; artificial neural network; bacterium; biomonitoring; concentration (composition); machine learning; pathogen; pollution exposure; prediction; remote sensing; satellite altimetry; water quality; accuracy; Article; artificial neural network; bacterial cell; bacterium culture; Enterococcus; environmental factor; nonhuman; precipitation; prediction; Puerto Rico; remote sensing; seashore; turbidity; water quality; environmental monitoring; feces; human; microbiology; procedures; satellite imagery; swimming; Puerto Rico; San Juan [Puerto Rico]; Bathing Beaches; Enterococcus; Environmental Monitoring; Feces; Humans; Neural Networks (Computer); Puerto Rico; Remote Sensing Technology; Satellite Imagery; Water Microbiology; Water Quality",,"water, 7732-18-5",,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1243510; National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, EPA: 83519301, OCE-1566562","A.E.L.R. was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) Partnerships for International Research (PIRE) under Grant No. 1243510 and by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Headquarters under the NASA Earth and Science Fellowship Program Grant No. NNX15AN60H.

Determination of water quality variables using mathematical models instead of laboratory experiments can have venerable significance in term of the environmental prospective. In this research, application of a new developed hybrid response surface method (HRSM) which is a modified model of the existing response surface model (RSM) is proposed for the first time to predict biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and dissolved oxygen (DO) in Euphrates River, Iraq. The model was constructed using various physical and chemical variables including water temperature (T), turbidity, power of hydrogen (pH), electrical conductivity (EC), alkalinity, calcium (Ca), chemical oxygen demand (COD), sulfate (SO 4 ), total dissolved solids (TDS), and total suspended solids (TSS) as input attributes. The monthly water quality sampling data for the period 2004–2013 was considered for structuring the input-output pattern required for the development of the models. An advance analysis was conducted to comprehend the correlation between the predictors and predictand. The prediction performances of HRSM were compared with that of support vector regression (SVR) model which is one of the most predominate applied machine learning approaches of the state-of-the-art for water quality prediction. The results indicated a very optimistic modeling accuracy of the proposed HRSM model to predict BOD and DO. Furthermore, the results showed a robust alternative mathematical model for determining water quality particularly in a data scarce region like Iraq. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Environmental prospects; Euphrates River; Soft computing models; Water quality variables","biochemical oxygen demand; chemical oxygen demand; dissolved oxygen; electrical conductivity; environmental assessment; hydrological modeling; physicochemical property; response surface methodology; river system; water quality; water temperature; Euphrates River; Iraq; oxygen; sulfate; water; analysis; biochemical oxygen demand; environmental monitoring; Iraq; procedures; prospective study; river; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; temperature; water pollutant; water pollution; water quality; Biological Oxygen Demand Analysis; Environmental Monitoring; Iraq; Models, Statistical; Oxygen; Prospective Studies; Rivers; Sulfates; Temperature; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Pollution; Water Quality",,"oxygen, 7782-44-7; sulfate, 14808-79-8; water, 7732-18-5; Oxygen; Sulfates; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Acherjee, B., Misra, D., Bose, D., Venkadeshwaran, K., Prediction of weld strength and seam width for laser transmission welding of thermoplastic using response surface methodology (2009) Opt Laser Technol, 41, pp. 956-967; Afan, H.A., Keshtegar, B., Mohtar, W.H.M.W., El-Shafie, A., Harmonize input selection for sediment transport prediction (2017) J Hydrol, 552, pp. 366-375; Ahmed, A.A.M., Shah, S.M.A., Application of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to estimate the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of Surma River (2015) J King Saud Univ Eng Sci, , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jksues.2015.02.001; Balabin, R.M., Lomakina, E.I., Safieva, R.Z., Neural network (ANN) approach to biodiesel analysis: analysis of biodiesel density, kinematic viscosity, methanol and water contents using near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy (2011) Fuel, 90, pp. 2007-2015; Barzegar, R., Adamowski, J., Moghaddam, A.A., Application of wavelet-artificial intelligence hybrid models for water quality prediction: a case study in Aji-Chay River, Iran (2016) Stoch Env Res Risk A, 30, pp. 1797-1819; Behmel, S., Damour, M., Ludwig, R., Rodriguez, M.J., Water quality monitoring strategies—a review and future perspectives (2016) Sci Total Environ, 571, pp. 1312-1329; Beven, K., On undermining the science?

RW turbidity was identified as the dominant variable affecting the distribution of the multivariate data, condensed into two principal components using principal component analysis. Thus two sets of models were developed based on the RW turbidity value: low turbidity models and high turbidity models. The performance of all models was satisfactory, with test correlation coefficients exceeding 0.85. The shapes of the plots of the parametric analysis were satisfactory and were in line with reported phenomena. However, the numerical accuracy of the plots obtained by the parametric analysis was poor. It was noted that using data with a wider range of values for the dominant variable (RW turbidity) helped improve the parametric plots. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","ELM-RBF; Residual aluminum; Water treatment","Aluminum; Chemical analysis; Chemical water treatment; Functions; Knowledge acquisition; Learning systems; Radial basis function networks; Turbidity; Water treatment; Chemical phenomenas; ELM-RBF; Extreme learning machine; Parametric -analysis; Principal Components; Radial basis function neural networks; Radial basis functions; Residual aluminum; Principal component analysis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Leardi, R., Nature-Inspired Methods in Chemometrics (2003) Elsevier, Amsterdam; Kennedy, M., Gandomi, A., Miller, C., Coagulation modeling using artificial neural networks to predict both turbidity and DOM-PARAFAC component removal (2015) J.

The models predicted the safety conditions of the water samples in the pipes with 98% accuracy and 94% respectively during testing. The high accuracy achieved in the model results indicate that contamination events in distribution systems that result in unsafe values of the water quality parameters can be detected using these classification models. This can provide water utility managers with real time information about the safety conditions of treated water at different locations of distribution pipes before water reaches consumers. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Contaminant detection; Distribution network; Machine learning; Water safety","Electric power distribution; Intelligent systems; Learning systems; Neural networks; Pollution detection; Safety testing; Support vector machines; Water quality; Water treatment; Classification models; Contaminant detection; Contamination events; Real-time information; Water distribution networks; Water quality parameters; Water safety; Water utility managers; Water distribution systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Besner, M.C., Prevost, M., Regli, S., Assessing the public health risk of microbial intrusion events in distribution systems: Conceptual model, available data, and challenges (2011) Water Res, 45 (3), pp. 961-979; Ercumen, A., Gruber, J.S., Colford, J.M., Jr., Water distribution system deficiencies and gastrointestinal illness: A systematic review and meta-analysis (2014) Environ.

Since the quality of water that we consume is a threatening alarm in the present scenario, the same must be analyzed and quantified to eradicate the ineffectiveness of the resource to a major extend. The water quality parameters as Total Dissolved Solvents, salinity, pH, turbidity has to be analyzed and subsequently should be controlled in order to have a better usage of the resource. An exclusive cost effective work is carried on to analyze qualitative parameters as Total Dissolved Solvents. The various salts were analyzed and classified depending on their optical properties. A simple photo sensor was fabricated and was transmitted through various water samples with some salt content and the salts are interpreted via machine learning approach. The work gave an insight to the major threats in the water scarcity and protection. © 2018 IEEE.","Classification; conductivity; feature extraction; K-NN.; machine learning; TDS","Classification (of information); Cost effectiveness; Electric conductivity; Feature extraction; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Optical properties; Salts; Water quality; Water resources; Cost effective; Machine learning approaches; Photo-sensors; Primary sources; Qualitative parameters; Quality of water; Water quality parameters; Water scarcity; Machine learning",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sandip Kumar Roy, J., Maxwell, C., Application of machine learning for real-time evaluation of salinity (or TDS) in drinking water using photonic sensors (1892) A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, 2, pp. 68-73. , 3rd ed.,.

When monitoring their respective water quality, in situ measurements of water quality parameters are spatially limited, costly and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a combination of hyperspectral data and machine learning methods to estimate and therefore to monitor different parameters for water quality. In contrast to commonly-applied techniques such as band ratios, this approach is data-driven and does not rely on any domain knowledge. We focus on CDOM, chlorophyll a and turbidity as well as the concentrations of the two algae types, diatoms and green algae. In order to investigate the potential of our proposal, we rely on measured data, which we sampled with three different sensors on the river Elbe in Germany from 24 June–12 July 2017. The measurement setup with two probe sensors and a hyperspectral sensor is described in detail. To estimate the five mentioned variables, we present an appropriate regression framework involving ten machine learning models and two preprocessing methods. This allows the regression performance of each model and variable to be evaluated. The best performing model for each variable results in a coefficient of determination R2 in the range of 89.9 % to 94.6 %. That clearly reveals the potential of the machine learning approaches with hyperspectral data. In further investigations, we focus on the generalization of the regression framework to prepare its application to different types of inland waters. © 2018 by the authors.

Efficient early warning systems that can detect contamination events require detection algorithms that can accurately predict the occurrence of such events. This paper presents the development of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) models for detecting the safety condition of water in pipe networks when concentrations of water quality variables in the pipes exceed their maximum thresholds. The event detection is based on time series data composed of pH, turbidity, color and bacteria count measured at the effluent of a drinking water utility and nine different locations of sensors in the distribution network in the city of Ålesund, Norway. The proposed ANFIS models correctly detected between 92% and 96% of the safety condition of the water in the pipe network, with approximately 1% false alarm rate during the testing stage. The models also achieved high rates of specificity and precision, with very high correlations between the predictions and actual conditions of the water in the pipes. The accuracy of the models achieved in this study suggests that the models can be useful in real time contamination event detection in the pipe networks.","Contaminant detection; Distribution network; Machine-learning algorithms; Water safety","Contamination; Effluents; Electric power distribution; Evolutionary algorithms; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Potable water; Safety testing; Water distribution systems; Water pollution; Water quality; Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS); Contaminant detection; Contamination events; Early Warning System; Intentional contaminations; Water distribution pipes; Water quality variables; Water safety; Pollution detection",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Besner, M.C., Prevost, M., Regli, S., Assessing the public health risk of microbial intrusion events in distribution systems: Conceptual model, available data, and challenges (2011) Water Research, 45 (3), pp. 961-979; Ercumen, A., Gruber, J.S., Colford, J.M., Jr., Water distribution system deficiencies and gastrointestinal illness: A systematic review and meta-analysis (2014) Environmental Health Perspectives, 122 (7), p. 651; Lambertini, E., Borchardt, M.A., Kieke, B.A., Jr., Spencer, S.K., Loge, F.J., Risk of viral acute gastrointestinal illness from nondisinfected drinking water distribution systems (2012) Environmental Science & Technology, 46 (17), pp. 9299-9307; (2015) Improving Environment and Health in Europe: How Far Have We Gotten?, , http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/276102/Improving-environment-health-europe-en.pdf, Copenhagen: WHO Regional Office for Europe; 2015.

For this purpose a set of 172 water samples were used in a way that water quality parameters and their water quality classes (from NSFWQI) were considered as the input–output of the models, respectively. Three assessment criteria, namely error rate, error value and accuracy, were applied in order to assess the performance of the applied models. The results revealed that under the condition that no parameter is removed, all the three models showed the same results. However, under quality parameters removal the results revealed that PNN was the best model, as that managed to classify water quality solely based on three quality parameters of turbidity, fecal coliform and total solids, at 90.70% accuracy, 9.30% error rate and error value was 4. In contrast to PNN, in the same condition, SVM showed the poorest performance. As with making use of four quality parameters namely fecal coliform, DO, BOD and total phosphates, it classified water quality at 88.37% accuracy and 11.63% error rate. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Classification;

For this purpose, hourly recorded water quality parameters of salinity, temperature and turbidity as well as the flow data of the Wailuku River were used. Several machine learning models including artificial neural network, extreme learning machine and support vector regression have been employed to investigate the river-flow-induced impact on the water quality parameters from the current time up to 2 h ahead. Following the input structure of the machine learning models, two separate models based on including and excluding the river flow were developed for each variable to quantify the importance of the flow discharge on the accuracy of the forecasting models. The performance of different machine learning models was found to be close to each other and showing similar pattern considering accuracy and uncertainty of the forecasts. The results revealed that flow discharge influenced the water salinity and turbidity of the bay in which the models including the river flow as input variables had better performance compared with those excluding the flow time series. Among the water quality parameters investigated in this research, river flow made the most and least improvement on the efficiency of the models applied for forecasting of turbidity and water temperature, respectively. Overall, it was observed that water quality parameters can be properly forecasted up to several hours ahead providing a potentially valuable tool for environmental management and monitoring in coastal areas. © 2018 The Author(s).","Estuarine and coastal waters; Machine learning; River flow; Salinity; Turbidity; Water quality",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aghbashlo, M., Shamshirband, S., Tabatabaei, M., Yee, L., Larimi, Y.N., The use of ELM-WT (Extreme learning machine with wavelet transform algorithm) to predict energetic performance of a DI diesel engine running on diesel/biodiesel blends containing polymer waste (2016) Energy, 94, pp. 443-456; Alizadeh, M.J., Discussion on “Gene expression models for prediction of longitudinal dispersion coefficient in streams” by Sattar, AMA, Gharabaghi, B., 2015 (2017) Journal of Hydrology, 524, pp. 587-596; Alizadeh, M.J., Kavianpour, M.R., Development of wavelet-ANN models to predict water quality parameters in Hilo Bay, Pacific Ocean (2015) Marine Pollution Bulletin, 98 (1), pp. 171-178; Atwood, T.B., Wiegner, T.N., Mackenzie, R.A., Effects of hydrological forcing on the structure of a tropical estuarine food web (2012) Oikos, 121 (2), pp. 277-289; Barzegar, R., Moghaddam, A.A., Adamowski, J., Ozga-Zielinski, B., Multi-step water quality forecasting using a boosting ensemble multi-wavelet extreme learning machine model (2018) Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assessment, 32 (3), pp. 799-813; Chau, K.-W., A review on integration of artificial intelligence into water quality modelling (2006) Marine Pollution Bulletin, 52 (7), pp. 726-733; Chau, K., Jiang, Y., Three-dimensional pollutant transport model for the Pearl River Estuary (2002) Water Research, 36 (8), pp. 2029-2039; Chenar, S.S., Deng, Z., Development of genetic programming-based model for predicting oyster norovirus outbreak risks (2018) Water Research, 128, pp. 20-37; Clark, J.R., (1995) Coastal Zone Management Handbook, , Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press; Corbari, C., Lassini, F., Mancini, M., Effect of intense short rainfall events on coastal water quality parameters from remote sensing data (2016) Continental Shelf Research, 123, pp. 18-28; Couch, C.S., Burns, J.H., Liu, G., Steward, K., Gutlay, T.N., Kenyon, J., Kosaki, R.K., Mass coral bleaching due to unprecedented marine heatwave in Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument (Northwestern Hawaiian Islands) (2017) Plos One, 12 (9); Dogan, E., Sengorur, B., Koklu, R., Modeling biological oxygen demand of the Melen River in Turkey using an artificial neural network technique (2009) Journal of Environmental Management, 90 (2), pp. 1229-1235; Espey, W., Ward, G., Estuarine water quality models (1972) Water Research, 6 (10), pp. 1117-1131; Fotovatikhah, F., Herrera, M., Shamshirband, S., Chau, K.-W., Faizollahzadeh Ardabili, S., Piran, M.J., Survey of computational intelligence as basis to big flood management: Challenges, research directions and future work (2018) Engineering Applications of Computational Fluid Mechanics, 12 (1), pp. 411-437; Franco-Lopez, H., Ek, A.R., Bauer, M.E., Estimation and mapping of forest stand density, volume, and cover type using the k-nearest neighbors method (2001) Remote Sensing of Environment, 77 (3), pp. 251-274; Garel, E., D’Alimonte, D., Continuous river discharge monitoring with bottom-mounted current profilers at narrow tidal estuaries (2017) Continental Shelf Research, 133, pp. 1-12; Gazzaz, N.M., Yusoff, M.K., Aris, A.Z., Juahir, H., Ramli, M.F., Artificial neural network modeling of the water quality index for Kinta River (Malaysia) using water quality variables as predictors (2012) Marine Pollution Bulletin, 64 (11), pp. 2409-2420; Heddam, S., Kisi, O., Extreme learning machines: A new approach for modeling dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration with and without water quality variables as predictors (2017) Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 24 (20), pp. 16702-16724; Huang, G.-B., Zhu, Q.-Y., Siew, C.-K., Extreme learning machine: A new learning scheme of feedforward neural networks.

Monitoring is essential for assessment and comprehensive overview of water status. Annex V of WFD define tree type of water quality parameters which need to be monitored (biological and two supported one-hydro morphological and physic chemical) in order to assess ecological status of water bodies. Remote sensing data can be used for monitoring and identification of water bodies over large scale regions in a more effective and efficient manner. However, this technique must to be integrated with traditions in situ sampling method and field surveying in order to provide precise results. Various empirical, semi-Analytics and machine learning algorithms exist to derive relationship between multi spectral image surface reflectance and water quality indicators derived from in situ measurement. In this study we evaluate the capabilities of Landsat 8 satellite image for assessment of abundance of phytoplankton's (biological parameters) and Turbidity, Dissolved oxygen, Total Phosphorus and Total Nitrogen (physic chemical parameters) in region of Vojvodina, Republic of Serbia. The Neuron Networks are used to analyzing correlation between in situ measurements and 7 Landsat 8 atmospherically corrected satellite images acquired in 2013. In situ data are obtained from Agency for environment protection of Serbia. Our results shows that satellite-based monitoring, in combination with in situ data, provide an improved basis for more effective monitoring of large number of water bodies over large geographical area. Relationship between derived and WFD quality parameters is established in order to provide usage of remote sensing data for ecological status classification according to WFD. © SPIE.

We leverage geo-spatial data analytics in combination with cloud based, real-Time in-situ sensing, that is capable of mapping changes in water turbidity of a water resource. Spatio-Temporal pollution insights are derived and represented via color-based heatmaps and matrices that are overlaid on Google maps and facilitate visualization and identification of pollution hotspots. Methods include first-order correlations derived from surface reflectance of different satellite band/s (single or a normalized difference combination) and high resolution, geo-Tagged, in-situ turbidity sensing via a moving multi-parameter sensor platform. Significant improvements in correlation (upto 80%) were obtained by using statistical methods such as moving average for filtering out the sensing data associated noise. Moreover, we use machine learning based approach for training a turbidity model based on Support vector machine (SVM) regression with Radial Basis Kernel (RBF). The predicted turbidity values for the selected region based on Landsat 8 Level 2 surface reflectance data, was then applied for time-series data for historical years of 2016 and 2017. The turbidity time series so obtained is analyzed to capture any significant variations in water quality due to various factors (event or season based). We propose a method to analyze pollution contributions from different individual sources, that is based on assigning an individual spatio-Temporal signature in the form of a color-coded matrix. Overall, Bluewater EYE could be useful for capturing water quality spatio-Temporal information and trends, providing data driven proofs for timely alerts and advisory and other useful insights for implementation of appropriate remediation measures and interventions-all this at an affordable cost. © SPIE.

Excessive sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) can cause coral bleaching, resulting in coral death and decreases in coral cover. A SST threshold of 1°C over the climatological maximum is widely used to predict coral bleaching. In this study, we refined thermal indices predicting coral bleaching at high-spatial resolution (1 km) by statistically optimizing thermal thresholds, as well as considering other environmental influences on bleaching such as ultraviolet (UV) radiation, water turbidity, and cooling effects. We used a coral bleaching dataset derived from the web-based monitoring system Sango Map Project, at scales appropriate for the local and regional conservation of Japanese coral reefs. We recorded coral bleaching events in the years 2004-2016 in Japan. We revealed the influence of multiple factors on the ability to predict coral bleaching, including selection of thermal indices, statistical optimization of thermal thresholds, quantification of multiple environmental influences, and use of multiple modeling methods (generalized linear models and random forests). After optimization, differences in predictive ability among thermal indices were negligible. Thermal index, UV radiation, water turbidity, and cooling effects were important predictors of the occurrence of coral bleaching. Predictions based on the best model revealed that coral reefs in Japan have experienced recent and widespread bleaching. A practical method to reduce bleaching frequency by screening UV radiation was also demonstrated in this paper. © 2018 Kumagai et al.","Adaptive measures; Citizen science; Conservation biology; Coral reefs; Degree heating weeks; Global warming; Terrestrial runoff; UV radiation","algorithm; Article; bleaching; climate; cooling; coral reef; environmental factor; heating; machine learning; process optimization; temperature stress; thermal analysis; turbidity; ultraviolet radiation; water temperature; wind",,,,,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT; Ministry of the Environment, Government of Japan, MOE","This work was supported by the SOUSEI and TOUGOU Program of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology in Japan (MEXT) and by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (S15) of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan.

We combined statistical (spectral analysis and Machine learning techniques) and physically based models to generate, for the first time in this system, a predictive tool of phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll-a) and composition (morphology-based functional groups). The results, based on a 11-year time series, revealed two alternating phases in the temporal dynamics of phytoplankton biomass. One phase is characterized by high inorganic turbidity and low phytoplankton biomass, and the other by low inorganic turbidity and variable (low and high) phytoplankton biomass. A threshold of turbidity (29 TNU), above which phytoplankton remains with low biomass (<15–20 ug/l) was established. The periods of high turbidity, which in total cover 30% of the time series, start abruptly and are related to external forcing. Meteorological conditions associated with the beginning of these periods were modeled through a regression tree analysis. These conditions consist of moderate to high wind intensities from the SW direction, in some cases combined with high antecedent precipitation or low water level. The results from the physically-based modeling indicated that the long decaying time-scale of turbidity and intermediate resuspension events could explain the prolonged length of the high turbidity periods (∼1.5 years). Random Forests models for the prediction of phytoplankton biomass and composition in periods of low turbidity resulted in a proportion of explained variance and a classification error over a test sample of 0.46 and 0.34 respectively.

The Microcystis aeruginosa complex (MAC) is ubiquitous worldwide. Their large colony size and relatively low numerical abundance imply that MAC abundance and presence are usually underestimated in traditional phytoplankton quantifications, which are based on samples of small volume. The objective of this work was twofold: (a) evaluate four sampling strategies of increasing sampling size to detect MAC organisms and (b) asses the predictability of MAC presence using easy-to-measure environmental variables. Sampling strategies were (I) 5–25 mL sedimented water samples inspected under inverted light microscope; (II) 20 L of water samples inspected by on-board naked-eye; (III) samples collected by towing a 25 μm pore size net inspected under light microscope; (IV) naked-eye inspection of 1000–7000 L concentrated water samples collected using a 115 μm-pore plankton net. We evaluated these objectives in a large environmental gradient (800 km) from freshwater to marine water (salinity range = 0–33) covering a wide range of temperatures (10–33 °C), underwater turbidity (0–158 NTU) and wind intensity (0–8 ms−1). Classification Random Forest models (presence/absence of MAC organisms) were constructed and evaluated for each strategy by randomly partitioning data into training (2/3) and test (1/3) sets. A systematic increase in average accuracy (from 51 to 90%) and sensitivity (from 45 to 94%) towards methods with larger sampling size was found (i.e. I–IV). The best obtained model showed a high accuracy (90%) and sensitivity (94%) to detect MAC presence. These results suggest that the presence of MAC organisms can be accurately predicted using easy-to-measure environmental variables once sampling size is adequate. The proposed methodology demands very low costs and could be readily incorporated in most water monitoring plans to provide early warning of MAC occurrence, even when there is a low biomass of organisms. © 2017","Cyano-Hab; Machine learning; Microcystis aeruginosa complex; Predictability; South America","Bacteria; Decision trees; Inspection; Learning systems; Microscopes; Pore size; Water management; Cyano-Hab; Environmental gradient; Environmental variables; Microcystis aeruginosa; Predictability; Presence/absence; Sampling strategies; South America; Biology; abundance estimation; algorithm; colony; cyanobacterium; detection method; environmental gradient; freshwater environment; machine learning; numerical model; prediction; sampling; species complex; species occurrence; South America; algae; Cyanobacteria; Equus asinus; Microcystis aeruginosa",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ahn, C.-Y., Joung, S.-H., Park, C.-S., Kim, H.-S., Yoon, B.-D., Oh, H.-M., Comparison of sampling and analytical methods for monitoring of cyanobacteria-dominated surface waters (2008) Hydrobiologia, 596, pp. 413-421; Azevedo, S.M., Carmichael, W.W., Jochimsen, E.M., Rinehart, K.L., Lau, S., Shaw, G.R., Eaglesham, G.K., Human intoxication by microcystins during renal dialysis treatment in Caruaru—Brazil (2002) Toxicology, 181, pp. 441-446; Beaulieu, M., Pick, F., Gregory-Eaves, I., Nutrients and water temperature are significant predictors of cyanobacterial biomass in a 1147 lakes data set (2013) Limnol.

Firstly, using data from eight United States Geological Survey (USGS) stations located in different rivers basins, USA, the S-ELM, R-ELM, OS-ELM, and OP-ELM were compared against the measured dissolved oxygen (DO) using four water quality variables, water temperature, specific conductance, turbidity, and pH, as predictors. For each station, we used data measured at an hourly time step for a period of 4 years. The dataset was divided into a training set (70%) and a validation set (30%). We selected several combinations of the water quality variables as inputs for each ELM model and six different scenarios were compared. Secondly, an attempt was made to predict DO concentration without water quality variables. To achieve this goal, we used the year numbers, 2008, 2009, etc., month numbers from (1) to (12), day numbers from (1) to (31) and hour numbers from (00:00) to (24:00) as predictors. Thirdly, the best ELM models were trained using validation dataset and tested with the training dataset. The performances of the four ELM models were evaluated using four statistical indices: the coefficient of correlation (R), the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), the root mean squared error (RMSE), and the mean absolute error (MAE). Results obtained from the eight stations indicated that: (i) the best results were obtained by the S-ELM, R-ELM, OS-ELM, and OP-ELM models having four water quality variables as predictors; (ii) out of eight stations, the OP-ELM performed better than the other three ELM models at seven stations while the R-ELM performed the best at one station. The OS-ELM models performed the worst and provided the lowest accuracy; (iii) for predicting DO without water quality variables, the R-ELM performed the best at seven stations followed by the S-ELM in the second place and the OP-ELM performed the worst with low accuracy; (iv) for the final application where training ELM models with validation dataset and testing with training dataset, the OP-ELM provided the best accuracy using water quality variables and the R-ELM performed the best at all eight stations without water quality variables. Fourthly, and finally, we compared the results obtained from different ELM models with those obtained using multiple linear regression (MLR) and multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN). Results obtained using MLPNN and MLR models reveal that: (i) using water quality variables as predictors, the MLR performed the worst and provided the lowest accuracy in all stations; (ii) MLPNN was ranked in the second place at two stations, in the third place at four stations, and finally, in the fourth place at two stations, (iii) for predicting DO without water quality variables, MLPNN is ranked in the second place at five stations, and ranked in the third, fourth, and fifth places in the remaining three stations, while MLR was ranked in the last place with very low accuracy at all stations. Overall, the results suggest that the ELM is more effective than the MLPNN and MLR for modelling DO concentration in river ecosystems. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Dissolved oxygen; Extreme learning machine;

While urbanization-induced poor water quality is a widely observed and well documented phenomenon, the mechanism to pinpoint local drivers of urban stream degradation, and their relative influence on water quality, is still lacking. Utilizing data from the citizen science project FreshWater Watch, we use a machine learning approach to identify key indicators, potential drivers, and potential controls to water quality across the metropolitan areas of Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hong Kong. Partial dependencies were examined to establish the direction of relationships between predictors and water quality. A random forest classification model indicated that predictors of stream water colour (drivers related to artificial land coverage and agricultural land use coverage) and potential controls related to the presence of bankside vegetation were found to be important in identifying basins with degraded water quality conditions, based on individual measurements of turbidity and nutrient (N-NO3 and P-PO4) concentrations. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Citizen science; Eutrophication; Machine learning; Turbidity; Urbanization; Water quality","Agricultural machinery; Artificial intelligence; Decision trees; Eutrophication; Land use; Learning systems; Quality control; Turbidity; Water quality; Agricultural land use; Citizen science; Machine learning approaches; Metropolitan area; Potential control; Random forest classification; Urbanization; Water quality improvements; Rivers; nitrate; phosphate; water; eutrophication; local participation; machine learning; metropolitan area; nutrient; stream; turbidity; urbanization; water quality; agricultural land; Article; China; color; Hong Kong; land use; machine learning; nutrient concentration; random forest; remote sensing; river basin; stream (river); turbidity; urban area; urbanization; vegetation; water pollution; water pollution indicator; water quality; watershed; city; community participation; environmental monitoring; procedures; river; total quality management; China; Guangdong; Guangzhou; Hong Kong; Shanghai; China; Cities; Community Participation; Environmental Monitoring; Hong Kong; Quality Improvement; Rivers; Water; Water Quality",,"nitrate, 14797-55-8; phosphate, 14066-19-4, 14265-44-2; water, 7732-18-5; Water",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aguilera, R., Marcé, R., Sabater, S., Detection and attribution of global change effects on river nutrient dynamics in a large Mediterranean basin (2015) Biogeosciences, 12, pp. 4085-4098; Amano, Y., Sakai, Y., Sekiya, T., Takeya, K., Taki, K., Machida, M., Effect of phosphorus fluctuation caused by river water dilution in eutrophic lake on competition between blue-green alga Microcystis aeruginosa and diatom Cyclotella sp (2010) J.

This paper presents a turbidity forecasting methodology capable of aiding operational staff and enabling proactive management strategies. The methodology presented here does not require a hydraulic or water quality network model that can be expensive to build and maintain. The methodology is tested and verified on a real UK trunk main network with observed turbidity measurement data. Results obtained show that the classification based forecasts of turbidity can reliably detect if discolouration material is mobilised up to 5 hours ahead. The methodology could be used as an early warning system to enable a range of proactive management strategies as an alternative to regular trunk mains cleaning. © 2020 CCWI 2017 - 15th International Conference on Computing and Control for the Water Industry.

Norovirus represent a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis in most developed countries. Modeling of general microbial occurrence in drinking water is a very active field of study and provides reliable information for predicting microbial risks in drinking water. In this work, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and Gaussian Process for Machine Learning (GPML) are proposed as predicting models for the total number of Norovirus in raw surface water in terms of water quality parameters such as water pH, turbidity, conductivity, temperature and rain. The predictive models were based on data from Nødre Romrike Vannverk water treatment plant in Oslo, Norway. Based on the model performance indices used in this study, the GPML model showed comparable accuracy to the ANFIS model. However, the ANFIS model generally demonstrated more superior prediction ability of the number of Norovirus in drinking water, with lower MSE and MAE values relative to the GPML model. In addition, the ability of the ANFIS model to explain potential effects of interactions among the water quality variables on the number of Norovirus in the raw water makes the technique more efficient for use in water quality modeling. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2017.","ANFIS; Conductivity; GPML; Norovirus; Rain; Temperature; Turbidity; Water conductivity; Water pH","Artificial intelligence; Electric conductivity; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Inference engines; Learning systems; Potable water; Rain; Surface waters; Temperature; Turbidity; Water quality; Water supply; Water treatment; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; ANFIS; GPML; Norovirus; Water conductivity; Water quality modeling; Water quality parameters; Water quality variables; Water",,,,,"244147/E10","Acknowledgements.

This paper presents a new turbidity forecasting methodology capable of aiding operational staff and enabling proactive management strategies. The turbidity forecasting methodology developed here is completely data-driven and does not require hydraulic or water quality network model that is expensive to build and maintain. The methodology is tested and verified on a real trunk main network with observed turbidity measurement data. Results obtained show that the methodology can detect if discolouration material is mobilised, estimate if sufficient turbidity will be generated to exceed a preselected threshold and approximate how long the material will take to reach the downstream meter. Classification based forecasts of turbidity can be reliably made up to 5 h ahead although at the expense of increased false alarm rates. The methodology presented here could be used as an early warning system that can enable a multitude of cost beneficial proactive management strategies to be implemented as an alternative to expensive trunk mains cleaning programs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Data-driven; Discolouration; Forecasting; Machine learning; Trunk mains; Turbidity","Human resource management; Hydraulic machinery; Learning systems; Turbidity; Water distribution systems; Water quality; Customer expectation; Data driven; Machine-learning; Management strategies; Operational staff; Proactive management; Short-term forecasting; Trunk main; Turbidity measurements; Water quality network models; Forecasting; classification; data set; distribution system; early warning system; forecasting method; machine learning; management practice; turbidity; water demand; water management; water quality; water treatment; Article; forecasting; machine learning; methodology; priority journal; random forest; support vector machine; trunk; turbidity; water quality; water supply; water treatment; forecasting; probability; water quality; water supply; United Kingdom; water; Forecasting; Probability; Water; Water Quality; Water Supply",,"water, 7732-18-5; Water",,,"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC","The authors are grateful to the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) for providing the financial support as part of the STREAM EngD project and to Julian Collingbourne of South West Water for supplying the data used in this paper.",,,,,,,,,,"Abarbanel, H.D.I., Brown, R., Sidorowich, J.J., Tsimring, L.S., The analysis of observed chaotic data in physical systems (1993) Rev.

Data from Landsat 8 and Spot 6 satellite images were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed models. The bathymetry results of the proposed models were compared with the corresponding results yielded from two conventional empirical methods: the neural network (NN) model and the Lyzenga generalized linear model (GLM). When compared with echo sounder data, the RF and MASS results outperformed Lyzenga GLM results. Moreover, the RF method produced more accurate results with average 0.25 m RMSE improvements range than the NN model.

Current metrics for assessing filtration performance from on-line turbidity data were critically assessed and observed not to effectively and consistently summarise the important properties of a turbidity distribution and the associated water quality risk. In the absence of a consistent risk function for turbidity in treated water, using on-line turbidity as an indicative rather than a quantitative variable appears to be more practical. Best practice suggests that filtered water turbidity should be maintained below 0.1 NTU, at higher turbidity we can be less confident of an effective particle and pathogen barrier. Based on this simple distinction filtration performance has been described in terms of reliability and resilience by characterising the likelihood, frequency and duration of turbidity spikes greater than 0.1 NTU. This view of filtration performance is then used to frame operational diagnosis of unsatisfactory performance in terms of a machine learning classification problem. Through calculation of operationally relevant predictor variables and application of the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm the conditions associated with the greatest risk of poor filtration performance can be effectively modelled and communicated in operational terms. This provides a method for an evidence based decision support which can be used to efficiently manage individual pathogen barriers in a multi-barrier system. © 2016 The Author(s)","CART; Fault diagnosis; Filtration; Turbidity","Computer aided diagnosis; Decision support systems; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Filtration; Learning systems; Risk assessment; Trees (mathematics); Turbidity; Water quality; Water treatment; CART; Classification and regression tree; Evidence- based decisions; Machine learning classification; Operational performance; Preventative maintenance; Rapid gravity filtration; Water treatment systems; Water filtration",,,,,"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC: EP/G037094/1","The authors would like to thank the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (Grant No: EP/G037094/1) and Scottish Water for their support of this work.",,,,,,,,,,"Rizak, S., Hrudey, S., Strategic Water Quality Monitoring for Drinking Water Safety, Salisbury, Australia, 2007; Barbeau, B., Gauthier, V., Bernier, A.-M., Millette, R., Tremblay, G., Impact of raw water turbidity fluctuations on drinking water quality in a distribution system (2003) J.

This paper presents a comparison of prediction methods for alum dosage using in water supply treatment process. In this research, we compared results from M5P, M5Rules and REPTree to the results from multilayer perceptron, one type of artificial neural network. Six input variables, i.e. turbidity, alkalinity, pH, conductivity, color and suspended solids relating to reaction of coagulation were used. The data in this research had been collected from Bangkhen Branch Office of Metropolitan Waterworks Authority, Thailand from 1 January 2006-31 July 2015. Our experimental results showed that the M5Rules method yielded the highest accuracy to predict Alum dosage comparing to other methods run in this study. For M5P and M5Rules, building model by using smoothing procedure and unpruned technique appears to give out the best model to predict with the highest accuracy. © 2017 The authors and IOS Press.","Alum dosage; artificial neural network; data mining; M5P; M5Rules; machine learning; MLP; multilayer perceptron; REPTree; water supply; Weka","Alkalinity; Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Forecasting; Learning systems; Multilayer neural networks; Multilayers; Neural networks; Water supply; Water treatment; Alum dosages; Data-mining software; M5Rules; Prediction methods; REPTree; Suspended solids; Treatment process; Weka; Chemical water treatment",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Valentin, N., Denoeux, T., Fotoohi, F., (1999) Modelling of Coagulant Dosage in A Water Treatment Plant; Barker, M., Nickels, M., Mayfield, H., (2003) Optimizing Drinking Water Treatment Using Neural Networks; (1979) Water Treatment Handbook, , Degremont Fifth Edition Wiley, New York; N.Y; Bernazeau, F., Pierrone, P., Duguet, J.P., Interest in using a streamline current detector for automatic coagulant dose control (1992) Water Supply, pp. 87-96; Nahm, E.S., Lee, S.B., Woo, K.B., Lee, B.K., Shin, S.K., Development of an Optimum Control Software Package for Coagulant Dosing Process in Water Purification System (1996) SICE '96, Proceedings of the 35th SICE Annual Conference, International Session Papers, pp. 1157-1161. , Tottori University, July 24-26; Han, T.H., Nahm, E.S., Woo, K.B., Kim, C.J., Ryu, J.W., Optimization of Coagulant Dosing Process in Water Purification System, SICE '97, Proceedings of the 36th SICE Annual Conference (1997) International Session Papers, Tokushima, pp. 1105-1109. , July 29-31; Chun, M.G., Kwak, K.C., Ryu, J.W., Application of ANFIS for Coagulant Dosing Process in a Water Purification Plant (1999) IEEE International Fuzzy Systems Conference Proceedings, Seoul, Korea, , August 22-25; Wang, Y., Witten, I.H., Induction of model trees for predicting continuous classes (1997) Poster Papers of the 9th European Conference on Machine Learning; Quinlan, R.J., Learning with continuous classes 5th Australian joint conference on artificial intelligence (1992) Singapore, pp. 343-348; Breiman, L., Friedman, J.H., Olshen, R.A., Stone, C.J., (1984) Classification, and Regression Trees, , Wadsworth Belmont CA; Geoffrey, H., Mark, H., Eibe, F., Generating rule sets from model trees (1999) Twelfth Australian Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pp. 1-12; Analysis of WEKA Data Mining Algorithm REPTree, , Simple Cart, and Random Tree for Classification of Indian News, Sushilkumar Kalmegh; http://weka.sourceforge.net/doc.dev/weka/classifiers/trees/REPTree.html; http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/","Chawakitchareon, P.; Department of Environmental Engineering, Thailand","Thalheim B.Jaakkola H.Kiyoki Y.Yoshida N.",,"IOS Press",,,,,09226389,9781614997191,,,"English","Front.

Many conventional methods aimed at improving visibility in low turbid water. High turbid underwater image enhancement is still an opening issue. Meanwhile, we find that the de-scattering and color correction of underwater images affect classification results. In this paper, we correspondingly propose a novel joint guidance image de-scattering and physical spectral characteristics-based color correction method to enhance high turbidity underwater images. The proposed enhancement method removes the scatter and preserves colors. In addition, as a rule to compare the performance of different image enhancement algorithms, a more comprehensive image quality assessment index Qu is proposed. The index combines the benefits of SSIM index and color distance index. We also use different machine learning methods for classification, such as support vector machine, convolutional neural network. Experimental results show that the proposed approach statistically outperforms state-of-the-art general purpose underwater image contrast enhancement algorithms. The experiment also demonstrated that the proposed method performs well for image classification. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Contrast enhancement; Deep neural network; Ocean optics; Quality assessment; Underwater imaging","Artificial intelligence;

Each water body can contain dramatically different levels of pollution. Water quality issues influence human and environmental health, so the more we monitor our water the better we will be able to recognize and prevent contamination problems. This paper presents the performance evaluation of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification techniques using Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence (DSTE) combination data fusion in monitoring of water quality. Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence (DSTE) was applied to increase the classification accuracy. This study involved the evaluation and interpretation of surface water quality data in Tilesdit dam (Algeria). It also allowed us to obtain more advanced information about water quality, and to design a monitoring network for this study area. The ANN and SVM which are two techniques for pattern classification have been widely used in many application areas such as water quality monitoring. These methods are binary classification techniques, but in some cases, such as pattern recognition, we need more than two classes. One of the suggested solutions for this difficulty is to split the problem into a set of binary classification before combining them. A multi-class problem using ANN and SVM is a typical example for solving the mentioned problem. The MLP network and the algorithm of SVM, one-against-all, are the most popular strategies for multi-class problems. In order to manage the conflict that results from using both approaches, the final decision is performed using DSTE's rule combination based on probabilistic output from both the two classifiers. In this work, four physicochemical parameters in 4 seasons during the period 2009-2011, located at Tilesdit dam in Bouira (Algeria), were selected for the purpose of this study, such as temperature, pH, conductivity and turbidity to supervise water quality. In order to evaluate their performances, a simulation using real dataset, corresponding to the recognition rate (training and test), is carried out. The results are compared to get the best performance evaluation of classification process which depends strongly on the choice of the excellent characteristics in training phase. The data fusion method improved significantly the performance of the intelligent approach in water quality classification. Moreover, the results demonstrated that the proposed procedure had great potential in water quality monitoring. © 2016 IEEE.","Algeria; Artificial neural network; Dempster-shafer theory; Fusion; Multi-class Classification; Support vector machines; Water quality","Bins; Classification (of information); Data fusion; Formal logic; Fusion reactions; Learning systems; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Probabilistic logics; Problem solving; River pollution; Statistical tests; Support vector machines; Surface waters; Water analysis; Water pollution; Water quality; Algeria; Classification accuracy; Classification technique; Dempster-Shafer theory; Dempster-shafer theory of evidence; Multi-class classification; Physicochemical parameters; Water quality monitoring; Quality control",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wang, Y., Wang, P., Bai, Y., Tian, Z., Li, J., Shao, X., Mustavich, L.F., Li, B., Assessment of surface water quality via multivariate statistical techniques: A case study of the songhua river harbin region, china (2013) Journal of Hydro-environment Research, 7, pp. 30-40; Zhou, W.F., Wu, B., Assessment of soil erosion and sediment delivery ratio using remote sensing and gis: A case study of upstream chaobaihe river catchment, north china (2008) International Journal of Sediment Research, 6 (23), pp. 167-173. , (2); Areerachakul, S., Sanguansintukul, S., Classification and regression trees and mlp neural network to classify water quality of canals in bangkok, thailand (2010) International Journal of Intelligent Computing Research (IJICR), 1 (1-2), pp. 43-50; Yan, H., Zou, Z., Wang, H., Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system for classification of water quality status (2010) Journal of Environmental Sciences, 22 (12), pp. 1891-1896; Liao, Y., Xu, J., Wang, W., A method of water quality assessment based on biomonitoring and multiclass support vector machine (2011) Procedia Environmental Sciences, 10, pp. 451-457; Rama Krishnan Mookiah, M., Rajendra Acharya, U., Min Lim, C., Petznick, A., Suri, J.S., Data mining technique for automated diagnosis of glaucoma using higher order spectra and wavelet energy features (2012) Knowledge-Based Systems, 33, pp. 73-82; Chen, X., Li, Y.S., Liu, Z., Yin, K., Li, Z., Wai, O.W., King, B., Integration of multisource data for water quality classification in the pearl river estuary and its adjacent coastal waters of hong kong (2004) Continent.

This study focused on the development of low cost mobile electronic sensors to monitor quality of water from rivers near mining sites. Low cost electronic sensors connected to a smart phone were developed to capture dissolved oxygen (DO2), pH, Turbidity, Temperature, and Salinity. The data for mercury (Hg) and arsenic (As) were obtained through AAS analyses to form baseline data for the model. Data was collected for over a period of one year, with site visits once every two months. A conditional inference tree (ctree) using recursive binary partitioning was used to generate the prediction model using 70-30 split on the training and test data set. The multi-feature model returns Good, Not Good or Unknown based on the scores of each element.

When mobilised, this material can cause discolouration. This paper explores factors expected to be involved in this accumulation process. Two complementary machine learning methodologies are applied to significant amounts of real world field data from both a qualitative and a quantitative perspective. First, Kohonen self-organising maps were used for integrative and interpretative multivariate data mining of potential factors affecting accumulation. Second, evolutionary polynomial regression (EPR), a hybrid data-driven technique, was applied that combines genetic algorithms with numerical regression for developing easily interpretable mathematical model expressions. EPR was used to explore producing novel simple expressions to highlight important accumulation factors. Three case studies are presented: UK national and two Dutch local studies. The results highlight bulk water iron concentration, pipe material and looped network areas as key descriptive parameters for the UK study. At the local level, a significantly increased third data set allowed K-fold cross validation. The mean cross validation coefficient of determination was 0.945 for training data and 0.930 for testing data for an equation utilising amount of material mobilised and soil temperature for estimating daily regeneration rate. The approach shows promise for developing transferable expressions usable for pro-active WDS management. © 2016 IWA Publishing.","Discolouration; Evolutionary polynomial regression; Material accumulation; Operation and maintenance strategies; Self-organising maps; Turbidity",,,,,,"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC: EP/G029946/1, EP/I029346/1; University of Sheffield; Science and Engineering Research Council, SERC","This work was supported by the Pennine Water Group – Urban Water Systems for a Changing World Platform Grant (EP/I029346/1) and by the Pipe Dreams project (EP/G029946/1), both funded by the UK Science and Engineering Research Council.

There have been several attempts to describe sediment mathematically using hydraulic characteristics of water bodies. Most researchers who developed empirical formulas to describe sediment transport performed laboratory experiments with assumptions that did not take into account variations of hydraulic parameters and the fine sediment sizes that are part of this phenomenon. Recently, new approaches for studying sediment transport have been developed involving the use of machine-learning algorithms that have proven accuracy and efficiency in predicting sediment transport. A novel machine-learning method, the Multivariate Relevance Vector Machine (MVRVM), has yet to be tested to model sediment transport and water quality in estuaries and lakes. The selection of the MVRVM is suggested by the limited field observations that present challenges for alternative statistical learning machines, and by the promise of using the MVRVM approach to inform future data-collection efforts. This paper tests the success of calibrating the MVRVM model to predict suspended fine-sediment transport and other environmental measures in Mud Lake, southeastern Idaho, United States. In addition, the authors introduce and explain the technique that can be used to arrange the data which will allow the model to work. Training and validation results for turbidity, total suspended solids (TSS), pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and water temperature are presented. These results emphasize that modeling the water-quality constituents and sediment transport with few observations is possible using the MVRVM. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Artificial intelligence; Biochemical oxygen demand; Dissolved oxygen; Hydraulic machinery; Lakes; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Sediments; Water quality; Environmental measures; Hydraulic characteristic; Hydraulic parameters; Laboratory experiments; Machine learning methods; Multivariate relevance vector machines; Statistical learning; Total suspended solids; Suspended sediments; algorithm; calibration; dissolved oxygen; fine grained sediment; hydraulic conductivity; lake water; machine learning; pH; prediction; sediment transport; shallow water; suspended sediment; water quality; water temperature; Florida [United States]; Idaho; Mud Lake; United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Batt, H., Stevens, D., Relevance vector machine models of suspended fine sediment transport in a shallow lake.

Successful flood prediction based on simulated hydrological behaviors has been proven dependent on accurate classification of these geographical factors. Several water-from-land extraction approaches using satellite images have so far been developed with common shortcomings, e.g., being prone to misclassification due to limited signal quality. This paper proposes detailed analyses of water classification from Landsat images based on prominent indices (Normalized Difference Water index: NDWI2, Modified Normalized Difference Water Index: MNDWI, Normalized Difference Turbidity Index: NDTI and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index: NDVI). It incorporated shadowed C- mean and contextual based labeling in water area classification, so as to ensure more robust extraction against compromised acquiring conditions, while suppressing spurious objects and background urban constructions. Unlike other conventional methods, where narrower or branching rivers were generally neglected, the Landsat image was integrated with higher resolution terrain surface during adaptive classification, to reveal subtle hydrological details. Empirical assessments, comparing against accurate manual delineation, suggested that the proposed method was able to delineate water surfaces with promising consistency. Specifically, it could extract water from studied areas with 97.74% of precision, 99.73% of recall, 98% of accuracy and 98.73% of F-measure. © 2015 International Information Institute.","Relaxation labelling; Satellite images; Shadowed C-means; Water body classification",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2012) Asian Disaster Reduction Center, , Natural Disaster Data Book; Prevention and restoration of the flood-risked areas in pathumthani (2012) Final Report, the Department of Public Works and Town and Country Planning, , Suranaree University of Technology, Pathum-thani; Dadhwal, V.K., Aggarwal, S.P., Mishra, N., Hydrological simulation of Mahanadi river basin and impact of land use/land cover change on surface runoff using a macro scale hydrological model (2010) Proceedings OflSPRS TC VII Symposium, pp. 165-170; Domnita, M., Craciun, A.I., Haidu, I., Magyari, S.Z., Geographical information system module for deriving the flash flood hydrograph in mountainous areas (2010) Proceedings of the 4th Conference on European Computing Conference, pp. 260-265; Wenxia, W.E.I., Chen, X., Ma, A., Object-oriented information extraction and application in high-resolution remote sensing image (2015) IGARSS, pp. 3803-3806; Xie, Y., Sha, Z., Yu, M., Remote sensing imagery in vegetation mapping: A review (2008) Journal of Plant Ecology, 1 (1), pp. 9-23; Wang, Y., Li, X., Zhang, L., Zhang, W., Automatic road extraction of urban area from high spatial resolution remotely sensed imagery (2008) International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) Congress Beijing, p. 61; Turker, M., San, K., Building detection from pan-sharpened IKONOS imagery through support vector machines classification (2010) Proc. of ISPRS Technical Com.

Unifying those single alarms from different indicators is usually performed by means of simple heuristics. A salient feature of the current developed approach is using a statistically oriented model for discrete choice prediction which is estimated using the maximum likelihood method for integrating the single alarms. The discrete choice model is jointly calibrated with other components of the event detection system framework in a training data set using genetic algorithms. The fusing process of each indicator probabilities, which is left out of focus in many existing event detection system models, is confirmed to be a crucial part of the system which could be modelled by exploiting a discrete choice model for improving its performance. The developed methodology is tested on real water quality data, showing improved performances in decreasing the number of false positive alarms and in its ability to detect events with higher probabilities, compared to previous studies. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Event detection; Logit analysis; Water distribution systems; Water quality; Water security","Alarm systems; Artificial intelligence; Decision theory; Genetic algorithms; Learning systems; Maximum likelihood; Quality control; Systems analysis; Water quality; Water supply systems; Contamination events; Discrete choice models; Event detection; Logit analysis; Maximum likelihood methods; Optimization method; Water quality indicators; Water security; Water distribution systems; data set; genetic algorithm; integrated approach; machinery; numerical model; optimization; performance assessment; pollution effect; statistical analysis; water quality; Article; artificial neural network; controlled study; electric conductivity; genetic algorithm; maximum likelihood method; pH; prediction; priority journal; radial based function; system analysis; temperature; total organic carbon; turbidity; water contamination; water distribution system; water quality; water supply; analysis; environmental monitoring; procedures; statistical model; water pollutant; water quality; water supply; drinking water; water pollutant; Drinking Water; Environmental Monitoring; Logistic Models; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Quality; Water Supply",,"Drinking Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,"Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF: GR 2443; Ministry of Industry, Trade and Labor, MOITAL; Office of the Chief Scientist, Ministry of Economy, OCS","The Technion part of this study was supported by the Technion Funds for Security research, by the joint Israeli Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS) Ministry of Industry, Trade and Labor (MOITAL) , and by the Germany Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) , under project number GR 2443.",,,,,,,,,,"Adams, J.A., Mccarty, D., Real-time on-line monitoring of drinking water for waterborne pathogen contamination warning (2007) Int.

After contamination detection, it is important to classify the type of contaminant quickly to provide support for implementation of remediation attempts. Conventional methods commonly rely on laboratory-based analysis or qualitative geometry analysis, which require long analysis time or suffer low true positive rate. This paper proposes a real time contaminant classification method, which discriminates contaminants based on quantitative analysis. The proposed method utilizes the Mahalanobis distance of feature vectors to classify the type of contaminant. The performance and robustness of the proposed method were evaluated using data from contaminant injection experiments and through an uncertainty analysis. An advantage of the proposed method is that it can classify the type of contaminant in minutes with no significant compromise on true positive rate. This will facilitate fast remediation response to contamination events in a water system. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Contaminant classification; Conventional sensor; Early warning system; Mahalanobis distance; Water quality","accident; early warning system; geometry; performance assessment; pollution monitoring; real time; sensor; uncertainty analysis; water quality; analytic method; Article; controlled study; geometry; injection; machine learning; quantitative analysis; sensor; turbidity; uncertainty; water analysis; water contamination; water pollutant; water quality; water supply; analysis; classification; environmental monitoring; procedures; time factor; water pollution; water pollutant; Environmental Monitoring; Time Factors; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Pollution, Chemical; Water Quality",,"Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,"2011Z01002; 2012ZX07408-002","This work is jointly supported by Tsinghua Independent Research Program ( 2011Z01002 ) and Water Major Program ( 2012ZX07408-002 ).",,,,,,,,,,"Bayro-Corrochano, E., Eklundh, J.O., Advances in theory and applications of pattern recognition, image processing and computer vision (2011) Pattern Recogn.

However, the high complex nonlinearity of water variables and their interactions makes it difficult in modeling its growth. Recently extreme learning machine (ELM) was reported to have advantages of only requirement of a small amount of samples, high degree of prediction accuracy and long prediction period to solve the nonlinear problems. In this study, the ELMbased prediction and forecastmodels for phytoplankton abundance in Macau Storage Reservoir (MSR) are proposed, in which the water parameters of pH, SiO2, alkalinity, Bicarbonate (HCO3−), dissolved oxygen (DO), total Nitrogen (TN), UV254, turbidity, conductivity, nitrate, total nitrogen (TN), orthophosphate (PO43−), total phosphorus (TP), suspended solid (SS) and total organic carbon (TOC) selected from the correlation analysis of the 23monthly water variables were included, with 8 years (2001-2008) data for training and the most recent 3 years (2009-2011) for testing. The modeling results showed that the prediction and forecast (based on data on the previous 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 12th months) powers were estimated as approximately 0.83 and 0.90 respectively, showing that the ELM is an effective new way that can be used for monitoring algal bloom in drinking water storage reservoir. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","Algal bloom; Extreme leaning machine; Phytoplankton abundance; Prediction and forecast models",,,,,,"Universidade de Macau, UM; Fundo para o Desenvolvimento das Ciências e da Tecnologia, FDCT: FDCT/016/2011/A","We thank Macao Water Co.

Technology development always focused to develop sustainable environment for the society. The technology and computation techniques are used for the prediction and analysis the environmental factors. The ability to predict the quality of water in an ecosystem is a very important issue. Given such a predictive model, authorities will be able to foresee an increase of the pollution levels and therefore instruct all the necessary precaution measures. Water quality prediction could also offer significant added value to several commercial applications such as irrigation and pisciculture. There are a number of variables to indicate the quality of water. Some of the basic variables are water temperature, pH, specific conductance, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, salinity, hardness and suspended sediment. The various models applied in water quality predictions are the Bayesian probability network model, inductive logic programming, regression trees, time series model such as autoregressive component models, neural network with active neurons, split step particle swarm optimization model and case based reasoning system. Among all the existing models, the machine learning algorithms can help make accurate predictions. If the water quality predictions are integrated with an intelligent alerting system, can issue early warnings based on the predicted hydrological parameters. © Research India Publications.","Environmental analysis; Temporal analysis; Water quality analysis; Water quality predication",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Najah, A., Elshafie, A., Karim, O.A., Jaffar, O., Prediction of Johor Water Quality Parametres using Artificial Neural Network (2009) European Journam of Scientific Research, voi, 28 (3), pp. 422-435; Blockeel, H., Dzeroski, S., Grbovic, J., Simultaneous prediction of multiple chemical parameters of river water quality with TILDE Proceedings of the 3rd European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 1704, pp. 32-40. , LNAI, Springer Verlag; Chau, K., A split-step PSO algorithm in prediction of water quality pollution (1997) Proceedings of the 2nd International Symposium on Neural Networks, pp. 1034-1039; Dzeroski, D., Demsar, S., Grbovic, J., Predicting chemical parameters of river water quality from bioindicator data (2000) Applied Intelligence, 13 (7-17); Fdez-Riverola, F., Corchado, J., CBR based system for forecasting red tides (2003) Knowledge Based System, 16, pp. p321-328; Fdez-Riverola, F., Corchado, J., Forecasting system for red tides (2004) Applied Intelligence, 21, pp. p251-264; Hatzikos, E., Tsoumakas, G., Tzanis, G., Bassilades, N., Vlahavas, (2007) An empirical study of sea water quality prediction, , Technical report, tr-lpis-231-07, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; Hatzikos, E., Anastasakis, L., Bassilades, N., Vlahavas, I., Monitoring water quality through a telematic sensor network and a fuzzy expert system (2007) Expert Systems, 24 (4); Rode, L.A.M., Long-term behaviour and cross-correlation water quality analysis of the river Elbe (2001) Germany Water Research, 35 (9), pp. 2153-2160; Ebenezer, M., (2001) Thesis: A comparative study on the ecography of tropical lentic systems of varied origin; Reckshaw, K., Water quality prediction and probability network models (1999) Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, 56, pp. 1150-1158; Romero, C., Shan, J., Development of an artificial neural network –based software for prediction of power plant canal water discharge temperature (2005) Expert System with Applications, 29, pp. 831-838","Clementking, A.; Department of Computer Science, Presidency CollegeIndia",,,"Research India Publications",,,,,09734562,,,,"English","Int.

Mud Lake is used as a sediment trap for the water flowing from the Bear River into the adjacent Bear Lake. This study explores the use of multivariable relevance vector machine (MVRVM) modeling to predict suspended fine sediment and other water quality constituent concentrations, and their spatial and temporal distribution. In this article, the first of two, we describe an experimental design and data collection program for the observations of water quality constituent data and hydraulic parameters to support creation of the MVRVM model. We briefly describe the MVRVM modeling approach, describe the development of the experimental program and the resulting observations, and finally discuss the suitability of the data to modeling with the MVRVM. Details of the MVRVM model and its application are provided in a second article. Success of the MVRVM will confirm the ability of statistical learning tools to predict sediment concentrations, and will lead the way for scientists to expand the use of the MVRVM for modeling of suspended fine sediment and water quality in other complex natural systems. © Copyright 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2013.","environmental impact assessment; fine sediment transport; management policy; mathematical analysis and modeling; multivariable relevance vector machine; numerical methods; statistical analysis; surface-water quality; watershed management","Experimental program; Management policy; Mathematical analysis; Relevance Vector Machine; Sediment concentration; Spatial and temporal distribution; Statistical learning; Watershed management; Data acquisition; Electric utilities; Environmental impact assessments; Hydraulic machinery; Lakes; Numerical methods; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Soil conservation; Statistical methods; Water conservation; Water management; Water quality; Suspended sediments; lake water; article; artificial neural network; particle resuspension; relevance vector machine; sediment transport; support vector machine; turbidity; velocity; water flow; water quality; water temperature",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artificial neural networks in hydrology I: Preliminary concepts (2000) J.

Modelling is an important tool when we want to reveal system properties of ecosystems. By modelling, one can relate ecological theories to ecosystem management. Much knowledge could be gained from modelling long term datasets of specific lake types especially those that have undergone eutrophication. Eutrophication or undesirable enrichment of nutrients (for example phosphorus and nitrogen) causes a vast proliferation of algal growth (especially blue green algae) and reduces water quality. The sequence of changes during eutrophication is rarely documented well although some elements are common. In order to understand the changes in the biotic community and water quality, it is important to identify the factors that affect both. The factors affecting algal growth are multidimensional and closely linked to physical factors (water temperature, light radiation, turbidity, turbulence and other conditions), chemical factors (pH, nutrient loading, humic substances, dissolved oxygen content) as well as biotic interactions (species specific competition, predation, grazing). As a consequence of high phosphorus and nitrogen loading together with suitable physical factors such as retention time and other environmental factors algal biomass increases with a succession of algal groups.Although the role of modelling in managing blue-green algal blooms has been clearly established, the gaps in modelling are currently reported to be related to catchment management and to biological processes beyond the direct influence of nutrients for example short-term community dynamics and long-term effects. Shallow lakes in particular are most difficult to study hence more difficult to manage. Research on predicting the dynamics of biotic communities and water quality in shallow lakes need modelling techniques that can discover complex non-linear relationships. Computational modelling or machine learning techniques are recognised for their ability to discover patterns in complex databases. This review highlights the application of computational modelling techniques to discover the nature and ecological effects of eutrophication in response to several management measures from case studies of two long-term lake datasets in The Netherlands. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In the present study, we select genetic programming (GP) for modeling and prediction of the membrane fouling rate in a pilot-scale drinking water production system. The model used input parameters for operating conditions (flow rate and filtration time) and feed water quality (turbidity, temperature, algae pH). GP was applied to discover the mathematical function for the pattern of the membrane fouling rate. The GP model allows predicting satisfactorily the filtration performances of the pilot plant obtained for different water quality and changing operating conditions. A valuable benefit of GP modeling was that the models did not require underlying descriptions of the physical processes. GP has displayed the potential to evaluate membrane performance as a feed-forward simulator toward an ""intelligent"" membrane system. © 2009.","Genetic programming; Membrane fouling; Prediction","Artificial Neural Network; Changing operating conditions; Drinking water production; Feed water; Feed-Forward; Filtration performance; Filtration time; Input parameter; Machine-learning; Mathematical functions; Membrane performance; Membrane system; Microfiltration systems; Model membranes; Operating condition; Physical process; Pilot scale; Prediction; Backpropagation; Computer programming; Computer software selection and evaluation; Functions; Learning algorithms; Membrane fouling; Membranes; Microfiltration; Models; Neural networks; Pilot plants; Porous materials; Potable water; Turbidity; Water filtration; Water pollution; Water quality; Hydraulic models; filtration; fouling; genetic algorithm; membrane; prediction; water quality; water treatment; algae",,,,,"Korea Institute of Construction Technology, KICT","This research was supported by a research grant (no. 2008-0206-45-1) from Korea Institute of Construction Technology(KICT).",,,,,,,,,,"Sahoo, G.B., Ray, C., Predicting flux decline in crossflow membranes using artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms (2006) J.

Understanding and modeling the level of eutrophication as a function of environmental parameters can be beneficial to coastal ecosystem management. The limitation of deterministic and empirical models in accurately predicting the level of algal blooms, and the nonlinear relationship between the water quality and environmental parameters and that of the level of chlorophyll a necessitate a new approach using machine learning and data-driven modeling. A multilayer perceptron-back propagation (MLP-BP) algorithm of artificial neural network (ANN) was used to predict the level of eutrophication (chlorophyll a) from water quality parameters monitored at two Florida Bay water quality monitoring stations (FLAB03 and FLAB14). Based on the correlation of monthly nutrients (total phosphate, nitrite, ammonium) and other water data (temperature, turbidity, and dissolved oxygen) to the level of chlorophyll a, an input-output data structure was selected. Seven input data scenarios were studied, and model performance was compared using four indices. Monthly data from 1992 to 2004 were partitioned into training and testing subsets. Results show that chlorophyll a was predicted well with the selected inputs, with an average R2 and model efficiency (E) of 0.856 and 0.582, respectively. Prediction with antecedent chlorophyll a alone gave a stable result with smaller error and higher performance attributed to easier and more efficient training. It was also found that ANN performed better at FLA03 than at FLA14. It is shown that the MLP-BP technique is applicable to the monitoring and prediction of algal blooms and will be crucial to coastal watershed management.","Artificial neural network; Chlorophyll a; Eutrophication; Florida Bay; Nutrient loading","algal bloom; artificial neural network; chlorophyll a; coastal water; coastal zone management; eutrophication; modeling; nutrient; water quality; Florida [United States]; Florida Bay; North America; United States; algae",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ANDERSON, J.A., BENNETT, D., SPOEHR, K., A study in numerical perversity: Teaching arithmetic to a neural network (1993) Neural Networks for Knowledge Representation and Inference, pp. 311-338. , LEVINE, D.S, and APARICO, M, eds, Hillsdale, New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum, pp; BARCIELA, R.M., GARCIA, E., FERNÁ NDEZ, E., Modeling primary production in a coastal embayment affected by upwelling using dynamic ecosystem models and artificial neural networks (1999) Ecological Modeling, 120, pp. 199-211; CAUDILL, M., BUTLER, C., Understanding Neural Networks (1992) Basic Networks, 1. , Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press; (2005) Everglades National Park, , http://www.nps.gov/ever/eco/fbrp.htm, FLORIDA BAY RESEARCH PROGRAM, accessed June 10, 2005; FRENCH, M. and RECKNAGEL, F., 1994.
